      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
A [=controller document=] is a set of data that specifies one or more
relationships between a [=controller=] and a set of data, such as a set of
public cryptographic keys. The [=controller document=] contains [=verification
relationships=] that explicitly permit the use of certain [=verification
methods=] for specific purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
It is expected that other specifications, such as [[[?DID-CORE]]], will profile
the features that are defined in this specification, requiring and/or
recommending the use of some and prohibiting and/or deprecating the use of
others.
      </p>

      <section id="conformance">
        <p>
A <dfn>conforming controller document</dfn> is any concrete expression of the
data model that follows the relevant normative requirements in Sections
[[[#data-model]]] and [[[#contexts-and-vocabularies]]].
        </p>

        <p>
A <dfn>conforming verification method</dfn> is any concrete expression of the
data model that follows the relevant normative requirements in Sections
[[[#verification-methods]]] and
[[[#contexts-and-vocabularies]]].
        </p>

        <p>
A <dfn class="lint-ignore">conforming document</dfn> is either a
[=conforming controller document=], or a
[=conforming verification method=].
        </p>

        <p>
A <dfn class="lint-ignore">conforming processor</dfn> is any algorithm realized
as software and/or hardware that generates and/or consumes a
[=conforming document=] according to the relevant normative statements in
Section [[[#algorithms]]]. Conforming processors MUST produce errors
when non-conforming documents are consumed.

        <h3>Terminology</h3>

        <p>
This section defines the terms used in this specification. A link to the relevant
definition is included whenever one of these terms appears in this specification.
        </p>

        <dl class="termlist definitions" data-sort="ascending">

          <dt><dfn>public key</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
Cryptographic material that can be used to verify digital proofs created with a

A process by which an entity can prove to a verifier that it has a specific
attribute or controls a specific secret.

          <dt><dfn data-lt="authorized|authorize">authorization</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
A process by which an entity can prove to a verifier that it is allowed to

          </dd>

          <dt><dfn class="export" data-lt="cryptosuite">cryptographic suite</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
A means of using specific cryptographic primitives
to achieve a particular security goal. These suites can
specify [=verification methods=], digital signature types,
their identifiers, and other related properties.<!--  See Section -->
<!-- [[[#cryptographic-suites]]] for further detail. -->
          </dd>

          <dt><dfn class="export" data-lt="controller(s)|Controllers">controller</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
An entity that is [=authorized=] to perform an action with a specific resource,
such as update a [=controller document=] or use a cryptographic key to generate
a digital signature.
          </dd>

          <dt><dfn class="export">controller document</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
A set of data that specifies one or more relationships between a
[=controller=] and a set of data, such as a set of public cryptographic keys.
          </dd>

          <dt><dfn data-lt="subjects">subject</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
The entity identified by the `id` property in a [=controller document=].
Anything can be a subject: person, group, organization, physical thing, digital
thing, logical thing, etc.
          </dd>

          <dt><dfn class="export">verification method</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
A set of parameters that can be used together with a process to independently
verify a proof. For example, a cryptographic public key can be used as a
verification method with respect to a digital signature; in such use, it
verifies that the signer possessed the associated cryptographic private key.
            </p>
            <p>
"Verification" and "proof" in this definition are intended to apply broadly. For
example, a cryptographic public key might be used during Diffie-Hellman key
exchange to negotiate a shared symmetric key for encryption. This guarantees the
integrity of the key agreement process. It is thus another type of verification
method, even though descriptions of the process might not use the words
"verification" or "proof."

          <dt><dfn class="export">verification relationship</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
An expression of the relationship between a [=subject=] and a
[=verification method=]. One example of a verification relationship is
[[[#authentication]]].

        <h3>Data Model</h3>

        <p>
A [=controller document=] is a set of data that specifies one or more
relationships between a [=controller=] and a set of data, such as a set of
public cryptographic keys. The [=controller document=] SHOULD
contain [=verification relationships=] that explicitly permit the use of
certain [=verification methods=] for specific purposes.

The following tables contain informative references for the core properties
defined by this specification, with expected values, and whether or not they are

            <h3>Subjects</h3>
            <p>
The identifier for a particular [=subject=] is expressed using the
`id` property in the [=controller document=].
            </p>

            <dl>
              <dt>id</dt>
              <dd>
The value of `id` MUST be a <a data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a>
that conforms to the rules in the [[[URL]]].
              </dd>
            </dl>

            <p>
A [=controller document=] MUST contain an `id` value in the
root <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a>.
            </p>

            <pre class="example nohighlight">
{
  "id": "https://controller.example/123"
}
            </pre>

            <p>
The `id` property only denotes the identifier of the [=subject=] when it is
present in the <em>topmost</em>
<a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a> of the [=controller document=].
            </p>

          </section>

          <section>
            <h3>Controllers</h3>

            <p>
A [=controller=] is an entity that is authorized to make changes to a
[=controller document=].
            </p>

            <dl>
              <dt>controller</dt>
              <dd>
The `controller` property is OPTIONAL. If present, its value MUST be a
<a data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a> or a
<a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-set">set</a> of
<a data-cite="INFRA#string">strings</a>, each of which conforms to the rules
in the [[[URL]]]. The corresponding [=controller document=](s) SHOULD contain
[=verification relationships=] that explicitly permit the use of certain
[=verification methods=] for specific purposes. If the `controller` property is
not present, the value expressed by the `id` property MUST be treated as if it
were also set as the value of the `controller` property.
              </dd>
            </dl>

            <p>
When a `controller` property is present in a [=controller document=], its value
expresses one or more identifiers. Any [=verification methods=] contained in the
[=controller documents=] for those identifiers SHOULD be accepted as
authoritative, such that proofs that satisfy those [=verification methods=] are
considered equivalent to proofs provided by the [=subject=].
            </p>

            <pre class="example nohighlight"
              title="Controller document with a controller property">
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/controller/v1",
  "id": "https://controller1.example/123",
  "controller": "https://controllerB.example/abc",
}
            </pre>

            <p>
While the identifier used for a [=controller=] is unambiguous, this does not
imply that a single entity is always the controller, nor that a controller
only has a single identifier. A [=controller=] might be a single entity, or a
collection of entities, such as a corporation. A [=controller=] might also use
multiple identifiers to refer to itself, for purposes such as privacy or
delineating operational boundaries within an organization. Similarly, a
[=controller=] might control many [=verification methods=]. For these reasons,
no assumptions are to be made about a [=controller=] being a single entity nor
controlling only a single [=verification method=].
            </p>

            <p class="note" title="Authentication versus Authorization">
Note that the definition of [=authentication=] is different from the definition
of [=authorization=]. Generally speaking, [=authentication=] answers the
question of "Who is this?" while [=authorization=] answers the question of "Are
they allowed to perform this action?". The `authentication` property in this
specification is used to, unsurprisingly, perform [=authentication=] while the
other [=verification relationships=] such as `capabilityDelegation` and
`capabilityInvocation` are used to perform [=authorization=]. Since successfully
performing [=authorization=] might have more serious effects on a system,
[=controllers=] are urged to use different [=verification methods=] when
performing [=authentication=] versus [=authorization=] and provide stronger
access protection for [=verification methods=] used for [=authorization=] versus
[=authentication=]. See [[[#security-considerations]]] for information related
to threat models and attack vectors.

          </section>

          <section>
            <h3>Also Known As</h3>

            <p>
A [=subject=] can have multiple identifiers that are used for different purposes
or at different times. The assertion that two or more identifiers (or other types
of URI) refer to the same [=subject=] can be made using the
`alsoKnownAs` property.
            </p>

            <dl>
              <dt>alsoKnownAs</dt>
              <dd>
The `alsoKnownAs` property is OPTIONAL. If present, its value MUST
be a <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-set">set</a> where each item in the
set is a URI conforming to [[RFC3986]].
              </dd>
              <dd>
This relationship is a statement that the subject of this identifier is
also identified by one or more other identifiers.
              </dd>
            </dl>

            <div class="note" title="Equivalence and alsoKnownAs">
              <p>
Applications might choose to consider two identifiers related by `alsoKnownAs`
to be equivalent <em>if</em> the `alsoKnownAs` relationship expressed in the
controller document of one [=subject=] is also expressed in the reverse direction
(i.e., reciprocated) in the controller document of the other [=subject=]. It is
best practice <em>not</em> to consider them
equivalent in the absence of this reciprocating relationship. In other words,
the presence of an `alsoKnownAs` assertion does not prove that this assertion
is true. Therefore, it is strongly advised that a requesting party obtain
independent verification of an `alsoKnownAs` assertion.
              </p>
              <p>
Given that the [=subject=] might use different identifiers for different
purposes, such as enhanced privacy protection, an expectation of strong
equivalence between the two identifiers, or taking action to
merge the information from the two corresponding [=controller documents=], is
not necessarily appropriate, <em>even with</em> a reciprocal relationship.

            <h2>Services</h2>

            <p>
[=Services=] are used in [=controller documents=] to express ways of
communicating with the [=subject=] or associated entities. A [=service=] can be
any type of service the [=subject=] wants to advertise for further discovery,
authentication, authorization, or interaction.
            </p>

            <p>
Due to privacy concerns, revealing public information through [=services=], such
as social media accounts, personal websites, and email addresses, is
discouraged. Further exploration of privacy concerns can be found in sections
[[[#keep-personal-data-private]]] and [[[#service-privacy]]]. The information
associated with [=services=] is often service specific. For example, the
information associated with an encrypted messaging service can express how to
initiate the encrypted link before messaging begins.
            </p>

            <p>
[=Services=] are expressed using the `service` property, which is described

The `service` property is OPTIONAL. If present, the associated value MUST be a
<a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-set">set</a> of [=services=], where each service is
described by a <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a>. Each [=service=] <a
data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a> MUST contain `id`, `type`, and
`serviceEndpoint` properties. Each service extension MAY include additional
properties and MAY further restrict the properties associated with the
extension.

                <dl>
                  <dt id="prop-service-id">id</dt>
                  <dd>
The `id` property is OPTIONAL. If present, its value MUST be a URL
conforming to [[[URL]]]. A [=conforming document=] MUST NOT include multiple
`service` entries with the same `id`.
                  </dd>
                <dt id="prop-service-type">type</dt>
                <dd>
The `type` property is REQUIRED. Its value MUST be a
<a data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a> or a
<a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-set">set</a> of
<a data-cite="INFRA#string">strings</a>. To maximize interoperability,
the [=service=] type and its associated properties SHOULD be registered in the
[[[?VC-EXTENSIONS]]].

                <dt id="prop-service-endpoint">serviceEndpoint</dt>
                <dd>
The `serviceEndpoint` property is REQUIRED. The value of the `serviceEndpoint`
property MUST be a single <a data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a>, a single
<a data-cite="INFRA#maps">map</a>, or a <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-set">set</a>
composed of one or more
<a data-cite="INFRA#string">strings</a> and/or
<a data-cite="INFRA#maps">maps</a>. Each <a data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a>
value MUST be a valid URL conforming to [[[URL]]].

          <h2>Verification Methods</h2>
          <p>
A [=controller document=] can express [=verification methods=], such as
cryptographic [=public keys=], which can be used to [=authenticate=] or
authorize interactions with the [=controller=] or associated parties. For
example, a cryptographic [=public key=] can be used as a <a>verification
method</a> with respect to a digital signature; in such use, it verifies that
the signer could use the associated cryptographic private key. <a>Verification
methods</a> might take many parameters. An example of this is a set of five
cryptographic keys from which any three are required to contribute to a
cryptographic threshold signature.

            title="The `controller` property is used by multiple objects">
The `controller` property is used by [=controller documents=], as described in
Section [[[#controller-documents]]], and by [=verification methods=], as
described in Section [[[#verification-methods]]]. When it is used in either
place, its purpose is the same; that is, it expresses one or more entities that
are authorized to perform certain actions associated with the resource with
which it is associated. To ensure explicit security guarantees, the
[=controller=] of a [=verification method=] cannot be inferred from the
[=controller document=]. It is necessary to explicitly express the identifier of
the controller of the key because the value of `controller` for a [=verification
method=] is <em>not</em> necessarily the value of the `controller` for a
[=controller document=].
          </p>

          <section>
            <h3>Verification Material</h3>

            <p>
Verification material is any information that is used by a process that applies
a [=verification method=]. The `type` of a [=verification method=] is
expected to be used to determine its compatibility with such processes. Examples
of verification methods include `JsonWebKey` and `Multikey`.
A [=cryptographic suite=] specification is responsible for specifying the
[=verification method=] `type` and its associated verification material
format. For examples using verification material, see
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-jose-cose/">Securing Verifiable Credentials using JOSE and COSE</a>,
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-di-ecdsa/">the Data Integrity ECDSA
Cryptosuites</a> and <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/lds-ed25519-2020/">
the Data Integrity EdDSA Cryptosuites</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
To increase the likelihood of interoperable implementations, this specification
limits the number of formats for expressing verification material in a
[=controller document=]. The fewer formats that implementers have to
choose from, the more likely that interoperability will be achieved. This
approach attempts to strike a delicate balance between easing implementation
and providing support for formats that have historically had broad deployment.
            </p>

            <p>
A [=verification method=] MUST NOT contain multiple verification material
properties for the same material. For example, expressing key material in a
[=verification method=] using both `publicKeyJwk` and
`publicKeyMultibase` at the same time is prohibited.
            </p>

            <p>
Implementations MAY convert keys between formats as desired for operational purposes or
to interface with cryptographic libraries. As an internal implementation detail, such
conversion MUST NOT affect the external representation of key material.
            </p>

            <p>
An example of a [=controller document=] containing <a>verification
methods</a> using both properties above is shown below.

            <p>
The JSON Web Key (JWK) data model is a specific type of [=verification method=]
that uses the JWK specification [[RFC7517]] to encode key types into a
set of parameters.
            </p>

            <p>
When specifing a `JsonWebKey`, the object takes the following form:

              <dt>type</dt>

              <dd>
                <p>
The `publicKeyJwk` property is OPTIONAL. If present, its value MUST
be a <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a> representing a JSON Web Key that
conforms to [[RFC7517]]. The <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a> MUST NOT
include any members of the private information class, such as `d`, as described
in the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517#section-8.1.1">JWK
Registration Template</a>. It is RECOMMENDED that verification methods that use
JWKs [[RFC7517]] to represent their [=public keys=] use the value of `kid` as
their fragment identifier. It is RECOMMENDED that JWK `kid` values are set to
the JWK Thumbprint [[RFC7638]] using the SHA-256 (SHA2-256) hash function of the [=public key=].
See the first key in
[[[#example-various-verification-method-types]]] for an example of a
public key with a compound key identifier.

                <p>
As specified in <a data-cite="RFC7517#section-4.4">Section 4.4 of the JWK specification</a>,
the OPTIONAL `alg` property identifies the algorithm intended for use with the public key,

key with multiple algorithms. As specified in <a data-cite="RFC7518#section-6.2.1.1">
Section 6.2.1.1 of the JWA specification</a>, describing a key using an elliptic curve,
the REQUIRED `crv` property is used to identify the particular curve type of the public key.
As specified in <a data-cite="RFC7515#section-4.1.4">Section 4.1.4 of the JWS specification</a>,
the OPTIONAL `kid` property is a hint used to help discover the key; if present, the `kid` value SHOULD
match, or be included in, the `id` property of the encapsulating `JsonWebKey` object,
as part of the path, query, or fragment of the URL.

}
            </pre>

            <p>
In the example above, the `publicKeyJwk` value contains the JSON Web Key.
The `kty` property encodes the key type of "EC", which means
"Elliptic Curve". The `alg` property identifies the algorithm intended
for use with the public key, which in this case is `ES384`. The `crv` property identifies
the particular curve type of the public key, `P-384`. The `x` and `y` properties specify
the point on the `P-384` curve that is associated with the public key.
            </p>

            <p>
The `publicKeyJwk` property MUST NOT contain any property marked as
"Private" or "Secret" in any registry contained in the JOSE Registries [[JOSE-REGISTRIES]], including "d".
            </p>

            <p>
The JSON Web Key data model is also capable of encoding <em>secret keys</em>, sometimes
referred to as <em>private keys</em>.
            </p>

            <pre class="example nohighlight"

    }
}
            </pre>

            <p>
The private key example above is almost identical to the previous example of the
public key, except that the information is stored in the `secretKeyJwk` property
(rather than the `publicKeyJwk`), and the private key value is encoded in the `d`
property thereof (alongside the `x` and `y` properties, which still specify
the point on the `P-384` curve that is associated with the public key).

The [=verification relationship=] between the [=controller=] and the
[=verification method=] is explicit in the [=controller document=].
[=Verification methods=] that are not associated with a particular
[=verification relationship=] cannot be used for that [=verification
relationship=]. For example, a [=verification method=] in the value of
the [=authentication=] property cannot be used to engage in
key agreement protocols with the [=controller=] &mdash; the value of the
<a href="#defn-keyAgreement">keyAgreement</a> property needs to be used
for that.
          </p>
          <p>
The [=controller document=] does not express revoked keys using a <a>verification
relationship</a>. If a referenced verification method is not in the latest
[=controller document=] used to dereference it, then that verification method is
considered invalid or revoked.
          </p>
          <p>
The following sections define several useful [=verification relationships=].
A [=controller document=] MAY include any of these, or other properties, to
express a specific [=verification relationship=]. To maximize
interoperability, any such properties used SHOULD be registered in the
<a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-specs-dir/#securing-mechanisms">VC Specifications Directory</a>.

If authentication is established, it is up to the application to decide what to
do with that information.
            </p>
            <p>
This is useful to any entity verifying authentication that needs to check
whether an entity that is attempting to [=authenticate=] is presenting a valid
proof of authentication. When such an authentication-verifying entity receives
some data (in some protocol-specific format) that contains a proof that was made
for the purpose of "authentication", and that says that an entity is identified
by the `id`, then that <em>verifier</em> checks to ensure that the proof can be
verified using a [=verification method=] (e.g., [=public key=]) listed
under `authentication` in the [=controller document=].
            </p>
            <p>
Note that the [=verification method=] indicated by the
`authentication` property of a [=controller document=] can
only be used to [=authenticate=] the [=controller=]. To
[=authenticate=] a different [=controller=], the entity associated with
the value of `controller` needs to [=authenticate=] with its
<em>own</em> [=controller document=] and associated
`authentication` [=verification relationship=].

when expressing assertions or claims, such as in verifiable credentials.

            <p>
This property is useful, for example, during the processing of a
verifiable credential by a verifier.
<!-- VC-DATA-INTEGRITY-SPECIFIC:

            <h2>Key Agreement</h2>

            <p>
The `keyAgreement` [=verification relationship=] is used to

            <h2>Capability Invocation</h2>

            <p>
The `capabilityInvocation` [=verification relationship=] is used
to specify a [=verification method=] that might be used by the
[=controller=] to invoke a cryptographic capability, such as the
authorization to update the [=controller document=].
            </p>

            <dl>
              <dt id="defn-capabilityInvocation">capabilityInvocation</dt>
              <dd>
The `capabilityInvocation` property is OPTIONAL. If present, the
associated value MUST be a <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-set">set</a> of
one or more [=verification methods=]. Each [=verification method=] MAY be
embedded or referenced.
              </dd>
            </dl>

            <p>
An example of when this property is useful is when a [=controller=] needs to
access a protected HTTP API that requires authorization in order to use it. In
order to authorize when using the HTTP API, the [=controller=]
uses a capability that is associated with a particular URL that is
exposed via the HTTP API. The invocation of the capability could be
expressed in a number of ways, e.g., as a digitally signed
message that is placed into the HTTP Headers.
            </p>
            <p>
The server providing the HTTP API is the <em>verifier</em> of the capability and
it would need to verify that the [=verification method=] referred to by the
invoked capability exists in the `capabilityInvocation`
property of the [=controller document=]. The verifier would also check to make sure
that the action being performed is valid and the capability is appropriate for
the resource being accessed. If the verification is successful, the server has
cryptographically determined that the invoker is authorized to access the
protected resource.
            </p>

            <h2>Capability Delegation</h2>

            <p>
The `capabilityDelegation` [=verification relationship=] is used
to specify a mechanism that might be used by the [=controller=] to delegate
a cryptographic capability to another party, such as delegating the authority
to access a specific HTTP API to a subordinate.
            </p>

            <dl>
              <dt id="defn-capabilityDelegation">capabilityDelegation</dt>

The `capabilityDelegation` property is OPTIONAL. If present, the
associated value MUST be a <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-set">set</a> of
one or more [=verification methods=]. Each [=verification method=] MAY be
embedded or referenced.
              </dd>
            </dl>

            <p>
An example of when this property is useful is when a [=controller=] chooses
to delegate their capability to access a protected HTTP API to a party other
than themselves. In order to delegate the capability, the [=controller=]
would use a [=verification method=] associated with the
`capabilityDelegation` [=verification relationship=] to
cryptographically sign the capability over to another [=controller=]. The
delegate would then use the capability in a manner that is similar to the
example described in [[[#capability-invocation]]].

Other Multibase encoding values MAY be used, but interoperability is not
guaranteed between implementations using such values.
          </p>

          <p>
To base-encode a binary value into a Multibase string, an implementation MUST

Other Multihash encoding values MAY be used, but interoperability is not
guaranteed between implementations.
          </p>

          <p>
To encode to a Multihash value, an implementation MUST concatenate the
associated Multihash header (encoded as a varint), the cryptographic digest
length in bytes (encoded as a varint), and the cryptographic digest value, in
that order.
          </p>

          <p>
To decode a Multihash value, an implementation MUST 1) remove the prepended
Multihash header value, which identifies the type of cryptographic hashing
algorithm, 2) remove the cryptographic digest length in bytes, and 3) extract
the raw cryptographic digest value which MUST match the expected output length
associated with the Multihash header as well as the output length provided in
the Multihash value itself.

The following algorithm specifies how to encode an array of bytes, where each

required inputs are the <var>bytes</var>, <var>targetBase</var>, and
<var>baseAlphabet</var>. The output is a string that contains the base-encoded
value. All mathematical operations MUST be performed using integer arithmetic.

is external to the [=controller document=]. As described in Section
[[[#integrity-protection-of-controllers]]], specifying a [=verification method=]
that is external to a [=controller document=] is a valid usage of this
specification. When retrieving any [=verification method=], especially when the
[=verification method=] might be cached, it is vital that the algorithm above is
used to ensure that there is a bi-directional reference from the [=controller
document=] to the [=verification method=] (via a [=verification relationship=])
and from the [=verification method=] to the [=controller document=] (via the
[=verification method=]'s `controller` property). Not ensuring this
bi-directional relationship exists can lead to security compromises where an
attacker poisons a cache by claiming control of a [=verification method=]
without the consent (that is, without a bi-directional reference) of the victim.

          <h4>Context Injection</h4>
          <p>
The `@context` property is used to ensure that implementations are using the
same semantics when terms in this specification are processed. For example, this
can be important when properties like `authentication` are processed and its
value, such as `Multikey` or `JsonWebKey`, are used.
          </p>

          <p>
When an application is processing a [=controller document=], if an `@context`
property is not provided in the document or the terms used in the document are
not mapped by existing values in the `@context` property, implementations MUST
inject or append an `@context` property with a value of
`https://www.w3.org/ns/controller/v1` or one or more contexts with at least the
same declarations, such as the Decentralized Identifier v1.1 context
(`https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1`).

          <p>
Implementations that do not intend to use JSON-LD MAY choose to not include an
`@context` declaration at the top-level of the document.

      <section>
        <h4 id="multibase">The `multibase` Datatype</h3>

        <p>
<a href="#multibase-0">Multibase</a>-encoded strings are used to encode binary
data into printable formats, such as ASCII, which are useful in environments
that cannot directly represent binary values. This specification makes use of
this encoding. In environments that support data types for string values, such
as RDF [[?RDF-CONCEPTS]], <a href="#multibase-0">Multibase</a>-encoded content
is indicated using a literal value whose datatype is set to
`https://w3id.org/security#multibase`.
        </p>

        <p>
The `multibase` datatype is defined as follows:
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt>The URL denoting this datatype</dt>
          <dd>
`https://w3id.org/security#multibase`
          </dd>
          <dt>The lexical space</dt>
          <dd>
Any string that starts with a [=Multibase header=] and the rest of the
characters consist of allowable characters in the respective base-encoding
alphabet.

The standard mathematical concept of all integer numbers.
          </dd>
          <dt>The lexical-to-value mapping</dt>
          <dd>
Any element of the lexical space is mapped to the value space by base-decoding
the value based on the base-decoding alphabet associated with the first
[=Multibase header=] in the lexical string.
          </dd>
          <dt>The canonical mapping</dt>

    <h1>Security Considerations</h1>

    <p>
This section contains a variety of security considerations that people using
this specification are advised to consider before deploying this
technology in a production setting. This technologies described in this
document are designed to operate under the threat model used by many IETF
standards and documented in [[?RFC3552]]. This section elaborates upon a number
of the considerations in [[?RFC3552]], as well as other considerations that are
unique to this specification.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Proving Control and Binding</h2>

      <p>
Binding an entity in the digital world or the physical world to an identifier, to
a [=controller document=], or to cryptographic material requires the use of
security protocols contemplated by this specification. The following sections
describe some possible scenarios and how an entity therein might prove control
over an identifier or a [=controller document=] for the purposes of authentication or
authorization.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Proving Control of an Identifier and/or Controller Document</h3>

        <p>
Proving control over an identifier and/or a [=controller document=] is useful
when accessing remote systems. Cryptographic digital signatures enable certain
security protocols related to [=controller documents=]
to be cryptographically verifiable. For these purposes, this specification
defines useful [=verification relationships=] in <a
href="#authentication"></a> and [[[#capability-invocation]]]. The
secret cryptographic material associated with the [=verification methods=]
can be used to generate a cryptographic digital signature as a part of an
authentication or authorization security protocol.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Binding to Physical Identity</h3>

        <p>
An identifier or [=controller document=] do not inherently carry any
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data">personal data</a> and
it is strongly advised that non-public entities do not publish personal data in
[=controller documents=].
        </p>

        <p>
It can be useful to express a binding of an identifier to a person's or
organization's physical identity in a way that is provably asserted by a
trusted authority, such as a government. This specification provides
the [[[#assertion]]] [=verification relationship=] for these
purposes. This feature can enable interactions that are private and can be
considered legally enforceable under one or more jurisdictions; establishing
such bindings has to be carefully balanced against privacy considerations (see
[[[#privacy-considerations]]]).
        </p>

        <p>
The process of binding an identifier to something in the physical world, such as
a person or an organization &mdash; for example, by using <a>verifiable
credentials</a> with the same subject as that identifier &mdash; is contemplated
by this specification and further defined in [[[?VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0]]].
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Key and Signature Expiration</h2>

      <p>
In a decentralized architecture, there might not be centralized authorities to
enforce cryptographic material or cryptographic digital signature expiration
policies. Therefore, it is with supporting software such as verification
libraries that requesting parties validate that cryptographic materials were not
expired at the time they were used. Requesting parties might employ their own
expiration policies in addition to inputs into their verification processes. For
example, some requesting parties might accept authentications from five minutes
in the past, while others with access to high precision time sources might
require authentications to be time stamped within the last 500 milliseconds.
      </p>
      <p>
There are some requesting parties that have legitimate needs to extend the use
of already-expired cryptographic material, such as verifying legacy
cryptographic digital signatures. In these scenarios, a requesting party might
instruct their verification software to ignore cryptographic key material
expiration or determine if the cryptographic key material was expired at the
time it was used.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Verification Method Rotation</h2>

      <p>
Rotation is a management process that enables the secret cryptographic material
associated with an existing [=verification method=] to be deactivated or
destroyed once a new [=verification method=] has been added to the
[=controller document=]. Going forward, any new proofs that a
[=controller=] would have generated using the old secret cryptographic
material can now instead be generated using the new  cryptographic material and
can be verified using the new [=verification method=].
      </p>

      <p>
Rotation is a useful mechanism for protecting against verification method
compromise, since frequent rotation of a verification method by the controller
reduces the value of a single compromised verification method to an attacker.
Performing revocation immediately after rotation is useful for verification
methods that a controller designates for short-lived verifications, such as
those involved in encrypting messages and authentication.
      </p>

      <p>
The following considerations might be of use when contemplating the use of
[=verification method=] rotation:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
[=Verification method=] rotation is a proactive security measure.
        </li>
        <li>
It is generally considered a best practice to perform [=verification method=]
rotation on a regular basis.
        </li>
        <li>
Higher security environments tend to employ more frequent verification method
rotation.
        </li>
        <li>
[=Verification method=] rotation manifests only as changes to the current or
latest version of a [=controller document=].
        </li>
        <li>
When a [=verification method=] has been active for a long time, or used for
many operations, a controller might wish to perform a rotation.
        </li>
        <li>
Frequent rotation of a [=verification method=] might be frustrating for
parties that are forced to continuously renew or refresh associated credentials.
        </li>
        <li>
Proofs or signatures that rely on [=verification methods=] that are not
present in the latest version of a [=controller document=] are not impacted by
rotation. In these cases, verification software might require additional
information, such as when a particular [=verification method=] was
expected to be valid as well as access to a verifiable data registry
containing a historical record, to determine the validity of the proof or
signature. This option might not be available in all systems.
        </li>
        <li>
A [=controller=] performs a rotation when it adds a new <a>verification
method</a> that is meant to replace an existing [=verification method=] after
some time.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Verification Method Revocation</h2>

      <p>
Revocation is a management process that enables the secret cryptographic
material associated with an existing [=verification method=] to be
deactivated such that it ceases to be a valid form of creating new
proofs.
      </p>
      <p>
Revocation is a useful mechanism for reacting to a verification method
compromise. Performing revocation immediately after rotation is useful for
verification methods that a controller designates for short-lived verifications,
such as those involved in encrypting messages and authentication.
      </p>

      <p>
Compromise of the secrets associated with a [=verification method=] allows
the attacker to use them according to the [=verification relationship=]
expressed by [=controller=] in the [=controller document=], for example, for
authentication. The attacker's use of the secrets might be indistinguishable
from the legitimate [=controller=]'s use starting from
the time the [=verification method=] was registered, to the time it was
revoked.
      </p>


      <p>
The following considerations might be of use when contemplating the use of
[=verification method=] revocation:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
[=Verification method=] revocation is a reactive security measure.
        </li>

        <li>
It is considered a best practice to support key revocation.
        </li>

        <li>
A [=controller=] is expected to immediately revoke any <a>verification
method</a> that is known to be compromised.
        </li>

        <li>
[=Verification method=] revocation can only be embodied in changes to
the latest version of a [=controller document=]; it cannot retroactively adjust
previous versions.
        </li>

        <li>
If a [=verification method=] is no longer exclusively accessible to the
[=controller=] or parties trusted to act on behalf of the [=controller=],
it is expected to be revoked immediately to reduce the risk of
compromises such as masquerading, theft, and fraud.
        </li>

        <li>
Revocation is expected to be understood as a [=controller=] expressing that
proofs or signatures associated with a revoked [=verification method=]
created after its revocation should be treated as invalid. It could also imply a
concern that existing proofs or signatures might have been created by an
attacker, but this is not necessarily the case. Verifiers, however, might still
choose to accept or reject any such proofs or signatures at their own
discretion.
        </li>

        <li>
Even if a [=verification method=] is present in a [=controller document=],
additional information, such as a public key revocation certificate, or an
external allow or deny list, could be used to determine whether a
[=verification method=] has been revoked.
        </li>

        <li>
The day-to-day operation of any software relying on a compromised
[=verification method=], such as an individual's operating system, antivirus,
or endpoint protection software, could be impacted when the <a>verification
method</a> is publicly revoked.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <section>
        <h3>Revocation Semantics</h3>

        <p>
Although verifiers might choose not to accept proofs or signatures from a
revoked verification method, knowing whether a verification was made with a
revoked [=verification method=] is trickier than it might seem. Some auditing
systems provide the ability to look back at the state of an identifier at a
point in time, or at a particular version of the [=controller document=].
When such a feature is combined with a reliable way to determine the time or
identifier version that existed when a cryptographically verifiable statement
was made, then revocation does not undo that statement. This can be the basis
for using digital signatures to make binding commitments; for example, to sign
a mortgage.
        </p>
        <p>
If these conditions are met, revocation is not retroactive; it only nullifies
future use of the method.
        </p>
        <p>
However, in order for such semantics to be safe, the second condition &mdash; an
ability to know what the state of the [=controller document=] was at the time
the assertion was made &mdash; is expected to apply. Without that guarantee,
someone could discover a revoked key and use it to make cryptographically
verifiable statements with a simulated date in the past.
        </p>
        <p>
Some auditing systems only allow the retrieval of the current state of a
identifier. When this is true, or when the state of an identifier at the time of
a cryptographically verifiable statement cannot be reliably determined, then the
only safe course is to disallow any consideration of state with respect to time,
except the present moment. Identifier ecosystems that take this approach
essentially provide cryptographically verifiable statements as ephemeral tokens
that can be invalidated at any time by the [=controller=].
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Encrypted Data in Controller Documents</h2>
      <p>
Encryption algorithms have been known to fail due to advances in cryptography
and computing power. Implementers are advised to assume that any encrypted data
placed in a [=controller document=] might eventually be made available in clear text
to the same audience to which the encrypted data is available. This is
particularly pertinent if the [=controller document=] is public.
      </p>
      <p>
Encrypting all or parts of a [=controller document=] is <em>not</em> an appropriate
means to protect data in the long term. Similarly, placing encrypted data in
a [=controller document=] is not an appropriate means to protect personal data.
      </p>
      <p>
Given the caveats above, if encrypted data is included in a [=controller document=],
implementers are advised to not associate any correlatable information
that could be used to infer a relationship between the encrypted data
and an associated party. Examples of correlatable information include
public keys of a receiving party, identifiers to digital assets known to be
under the control of a receiving party, or human readable descriptions of a
receiving party.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Content Integrity Protection</h2>
      <p>
[=Controller documents=] that include links to external machine-readable
content such as images, web pages, or schemas are vulnerable to tampering. It is
strongly advised that external links are integrity protected using mechanisms to
secure related resources such as those described in the [[[?VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0]]]
specification. External links are to be avoided if they cannot be integrity
protected and the [=controller document=]'s integrity is dependent on the
external link.
      </p>
      <p>
One example of an external link where the integrity of the <a>controller
document</a> itself could be affected is the JSON-LD Context [[JSON-LD11]],
when present. To protect against compromise,
[=controller document=] consumers using JSON-LD are advised to cache
local static copies of JSON-LD contexts and/or verify the integrity of external
contexts against a cryptographic hash that is known to be associated with a safe
version of the external JSON-LD Context.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Level of Assurance</h2>

      <p>
Additional information about the security context of authentication events is
often required for compliance reasons, especially in regulated areas such as the
financial and public sectors. This information is often referred to as a Level
of Assurance (LOA). Examples include the protection of secret cryptographic
material, the identity proofing process, and the form-factor of the
authenticator.
      </p>

29115:2013</a>, including their requirements for the security context, and
making recommendations on how to achieve them. This might include strong user
authentication where <a target="_blank"
href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">FIDO2</a>/<a target="_blank"
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/">WebAuthn</a> can fulfill the
requirement.
      </p>

      <p>
Some regulated scenarios require the implementation of a specific level of
assurance. Since [=verification relationships=] used to perform
<a href="#assertion">assertion</a> and [=authentication=] might be
used in some of these situations, information about the applied security context
might need to be expressed and provided to a <em>verifier</em>. Whether and how
to encode this information in the [=controller document=] data model is out
of scope for this specification. Interested readers might note that 1) the
information could be transmitted using Verifiable Credentials
[[?VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0]], and 2) the [=controller document=] data model can be
extended to incorporate this information.

responsibility of the [=service=] provider, [=subject=], and/or requesting party
to comply with the requirements of the authentication and/or authorization

    <h1>Privacy Considerations</h1>

    <p>
Since [=controller documents=] are designed to be administered directly by

Privacy by Design [[PRIVACY-BY-DESIGN]] to all aspects of the
[=controller document=]. All seven of these principles have been applied
throughout the development of this specification. The design used in this

other intermediate service provider to recommend or apply additional privacy
safeguards. Privacy in this specification is preventive, not remedial, and is an

contain no personal data. Personal data can instead be transmitted through other
means such as 1) verifiable credentials [[?VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0]], or 2)
other private communication channels.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Identifier Correlation Risks</h2>

      <p>
Identifiers can be used for the purpose of correlation.
[=Controllers=] can mitigate this privacy risk by using pairwise identifiers
that are unique to each relationship; in effect, each identifier acts as a
pseudonym. A pairwise identifier need only be shared with more than one party
when correlation is explicitly desired. If pairwise identifiers are the default,
then the only need to publish an identifier openly, or to share it with multiple
parties, is when the [=controllers=] and/or [=subjects=] explicitly
desire public identification and correlation.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Controller Document Correlation Risks</h2>

      <p>
The anti-correlation protections of pairwise identifiers are easily defeated if
the data in the corresponding [=controller documents=] can be correlated. For
example, using identical [=verification methods=] in multiple <a>controller
documents</a> can provide as much correlation information as using the same
identifier. Therefore, the [=controller document=] for a pairwise identifier
also needs to use pairwise unique information, such as ensuring that
[=verification methods=] are unique to the pairwise relationship.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Subject Classification</h2>
      <p>
It is dangerous to add properties to the [=controller document=] that can be
used to indicate, explicitly or through inference, what <em>type</em> or nature
of thing the [=subject=] is, particularly if the [=subject=] is a person.
      </p>
      <p>
Not only do such properties potentially result in personal data (see
[[[#keep-personal-data-private]]]) or correlatable data (see <a
href="#identifier-correlation-risks"> </a> and
[[[#controller-document-correlation-risks]]]) being present in
the [=controller document=], but they can be used for grouping particular
identifiers in such a way that they are included in or excluded from certain
operations or functionalities.
      </p>
      <p>
Including <em>type</em> information in a [=controller document=] can result
in personal privacy harms even for [=subjects=] that are non-person entities,
such as IoT devices. The aggregation of such information around a
[=controller=] could serve as a form of digital fingerprint and this is best
avoided.
      </p>
      <p>
To minimize these risks, all properties in a [=controller document=] ought to
be for expressing [=verification methods=] and <a>verification
relationships</a> related to using the identifier.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Service Privacy</h2>
      <p>
The ability for a [=controller=] to optionally express at least one [=service=] in the [=controller document=] increases their control and agency.
Each additional endpoint in the [=controller document=] adds privacy risk either
due to correlation, such as across endpoint descriptions, or because the
[=services=] are not protected by an authorization mechanism, or both.
      </p>
      <p>
[=Controller documents=] are often public and, since they are standardized, will
be stored and indexed efficiently. This
risk is increased if [=controller documents=] are published to immutable
[=verifiable data registries=]. Access to a history of the [=controller
documents=] referenced by a URL enables a form of traffic analysis made more
efficient through the use of standards.
      </p>
      <p>
The degree of additional privacy risk caused by including multiple [=services=] in
one [=controller document=] can be difficult to estimate. Privacy harms are
typically unintended consequences. URLs can refer to documents, [=services=],
schemas, and other things that might be associated with individual people,
households, clubs, and employers &mdash; and correlation of their [=services=]
could become a powerful surveillance and inference tool. An example of
this potential harm can be seen when multiple common country-level top level
domains such as `https://example.co.uk` might be used to infer the approximate
location of the [=subject=] with a greater degree of probability.

      <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>
      <p>
The following section describes accessibility considerations that developers
implementing this specification are urged to consider in order to ensure that
their software is usable by people with different cognitive, motor, and visual
needs. As a general rule, this specification is used by system software and does
not directly expose individuals to information subject to accessibility
considerations. However, there are instances where individuals might be
indirectly exposed to information expressed by this specification and thus the
guidance below is provided for those situations.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Presenting Time Values</h2>
        <p>
This specification enables the expression of dates and times related to the
validity period of cryptographic proofs. This information might be indirectly
exposed to an individual if a proof is processed and is detected to be outside
an allowable time range. When exposing these dates and times to an individual,
implementers are urged to take into account
<a data-cite="?VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0#representing-time">cultural normas and locales
when representing dates and times</a> in display software. In addition to these
considerations, presenting time values in a way that eases the cognitive burden
on the individual receiving the information is a suggested best practice.
        </p>
        <p>
For example, when conveying the expiration date for a particular set of
digitally signed information, implementers are urged to present the time of
expiration using language that is easier to understand rather than language that
optimizes for accuracy. Presenting the expiration time as "This ticket expired
three days ago." is preferred over a phrase such as "This ticket expired on July
25th 2023 at 3:43 PM." The former provides a relative time that is easier to
comprehend than the latter time, which requires the individual to do the
calculation in their head and presumes that they are capable of doing such a
calculation.
