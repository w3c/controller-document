The Working Group is actively seeking implementation feedback for this
specification. In order to exit the Candidate Recommendation phase, the
Working Group has set the requirement of at least two independent
implementations for each mandatory feature in the specification. Please see
the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/cid/implementations/1.0/">
implementation report</a> for more details.
      </p>

      <p class="atrisk issue"
        title="Features with less than two independent implementations">
Any feature with less than two independent implementations in the
<a href="https://w3c.github.io/cid/implementations/1.0/">
implementation report</a> is an "at risk" feature and might be
removed before the transition to W3C Proposed Recommendation.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
[=Controlled identifier documents=] identify a [=subject=] and provide [=verification
methods=] that express public cryptographic material, such as [=public keys=],
for verifying [=proofs=] created on behalf of the [=subject=] for specific
purposes, such as authentication, attestation, key agreement (for encryption),
and capability invocation and delegation. [=Controlled identifier documents=] also list
[=service=] endpoints related to an [=identifier=]; for example, from which to
request additional information for verification.
      </p>

      <p>
In other words, the controlled identifier document contains the information necessary to
communicate with, and/or prove that specific actions were taken by, the
controller of an [=identifier=], including material for [=proofs=] and
[=service=] endpoints for additional communications.
      </p>
      <p>
A [=controlled identifier document=] specifies
[=verification relationships=] and [=service=] endpoints for a single
identifier, for which the current controlled identifier document is taken as authoritative.
      </p>
      <p>
It is expected that other specifications will profile
the features that are defined in this specification, requiring and/or
recommending the use of some and prohibiting and/or deprecating the use of
others.
      </p>

      <p class="issue" title="Clarify that profiles of this document will happen">
The W3C TAG review noted that they would like to see language that clarifies
that this document would be useful to authors that would like to profile its
usage. The DID Core specification is one such document that does that, but
citing it directly received objections. This issue notes that the WG intends to
resolve the text below into something that we can achieve consensus on:<br><br>
<em>For example, the Decentralized Identifiers Specification is expected to
define DID documents as a profile of controlled identifier documents, where the DID is the
identifier, DID documents are controlled identifier documents, and resolution is the
process of retrieving the canonical DID document for a DID.</em>
      </p>

        <h3>Use Cases</h3>
        <p>
The use cases below illustrate the need for this specification.
While many other related use cases exist, such as those in [[[DID-USE-CASES]]]
and [[[VC-USE-CASES]]], those described below are the main scenarios that this
specification is designed to address.
        </p>

        <section class="notoc">
          <h4>Globally Unique Identifiers</h4>

          <p>
Lemmy runs multiple enterprise portals that manage large amounts of sensitive
data submitted by people working for a variety of organizations. He would like
to use identifiers for entities in the databases that are provided by
his customers and do not depend on easily phishable information such as
email addresses and passwords.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="notoc">
          <h4>Cryptographic Verification</h4>

          <p>
Lemmy would like to ensure that his customers prove control over their
identifiers &mdash; for example, by using public/private key cryptography
&mdash; in order to increase security related to who is allowed to access and
update each organization's data.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="notoc">
          <h4>Cryptographic Purpose</h4>

          <p>
Stef, who operates a high security service, would like to ensure that certain
cryptographic keys used by his customers can only be used for specific purposes
(such as encryption, authorization, and/or authentication) to enable different
levels of access and protection for each type of cryptographic key.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="notoc">
          <h4>Service Engagement</h4>

          <p>
Marge, a software developer, would like to publicly advertise ways in which
other people on the Web can reach her through various communication services she
uses based on her globally unique identifier(s).
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="notoc">
          <h4>Extensibility</h4>

          <p>
Cory, a systems architect, would like to extend the use cases described in this
section in a way that provides new functionality without creating conflicts
with extensions being added by others.
          </p>
        </section>

          <h4>Issue and Present Claims</h4>

          <p>
Neru would like to issue digital credentials on behalf of her company that
contain claims about their employees. The claims that are made need to use
identifiers that are cryptographically attributable back to Neru's company and
need to allow for the holder's of those credentials to be able to
cryptographically authenticate themselves when they present the credential.

        <h3>Requirements</h3>

        <p>
The following requirements are derived from the use cases described earlier in
this specification. Additional requirements which could lead to a more
decentralized solution can be found in [[[DID-USE-CASES]]].
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt>1. Guaranteed Unique Identifier</dt>
          <dd>
Identifiers are globally unique with no possibility of duplication.
          </dd>
          <dt>2. Proof of Control</dt>
          <dd>
It is possible to prove that the entity claiming control over the identifier is
indeed its controller.
          </dd>
          <dt>3. Associated cryptographic material</dt>
          <dd>
The identifier is tightly coupled with cryptographic material that an entity
can use to prove control over that identifier.
          </dd>
          <dt>4. Streamlined key rotation</dt>
          <dd>
Entities denoted by designated identifiers can update authentication materials
without direct intervention by requesting parties and with minimal individual
interaction.
          </dd>
          <dt>5. Service endpoint discovery</dt>
          <dd>

            <h3>Subjects</h3>
            <p>
A [=subject=] is expressed using the `id` property in a [=controlled identifier document=].
The value of an `id` property is referred to as an <dfn>identifier</dfn>.
            </p>

            <dl>
              <dt>id</dt>
              <dd>
The value of `id` property MUST be a <a data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a> that
conforms to the rules in the [[[URL]]].
              </dd>
            </dl>

            <p>
A [=controlled identifier document=] MUST contain an `id` value in the <em>topmost</em>
<a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a>.
            </p>

            <pre class="example nohighlight">
{
  "id": "https://controller.example/123"
}
            </pre>

            <p>
The value of the `id` property in the <em>topmost</em>
<a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a> of the [=controlled identifier document=] is
called the <dfn>base identifier</dfn> for the [=controlled identifier document=]. The URL
for retrieving the current, authoritative [=controlled identifier document=] for a given
[=identifier=] is called the <dfn>canonical URL</dfn> for the [=controlled identifier
document=]. Dereferencing the [=canonical URL=] MUST return the current
authoritative [=controlled identifier document=]. The returned document's [=base
identifier=] MUST be the same as the [=canonical URL=]; if it is anything else,
then the returned document is not an authoritative [=controlled identifier document=] and
the [=identifier=] SHOULD be treated as invalid. Every controlled identifier document is
stored and retrieved according to the [=canonical URL=] of the document, which
MUST also be the [=base identifier=] of the document.
            </p>

            <div class="note" title="Identifiers are context-dependent">
              <p>
It is expected that the [=subject=] referred to by an `id` in a [=controlled identifier
document=] will be consistent over time, such that any [=verifiable
credentials=] that use them can be interpreted as referring to the same entity.
For example, it is preferred that an [=issuer=] of a [=verifiable credential=]
require that a [=subject=] demonstrate [=proof=] of control over their
[=identifier=] before issuing a credential with that [=identifier=] as
[=subject=], creating assurance that the same entity was involved in the
issuance of each credential with that [=identifier=] as [=subject=].
              </p>
              <p>
However, there are valid cases where that practice is either impossible or
unreasonable; for example, when a parent requests a [=verifiable credential=]
for their child. There are also cases where an [=issuer=] simply makes a mistake
or intentionally issues a false statement. All of these possibilities are
considered when evaluating the security impacts of reliance on a given
[=identifier=] for any given purpose. See Section [[[#identifier-ambiguity]]].

            <h3>Controllers</h3>

            <p>
A [=controller=] of a [=controlled identifier document=] is any entity capable of making changes to that
[=controlled identifier document=]. Whoever can update
the content of the resource returned from dereferencing the controller
document's canonical URL is, by definition, a controller of the
document and its canonical identifier. Proofs that satisfy a
[=controlled identifier document=]'s [=verification methods=] are taken as cryptographic
assurance that the [=controller=] of the [=identifier=] created those [=proofs=].
            </p>
            <p class="note" title="Identifier Controller versus Document Controller">
The [=controller=] of the [=controlled identifier document=] is taken to be the
[=controller=] of the document's canonical [=identifier=], also known as its
URL. That is, whoever can update the [=controlled identifier document=] is both
the document [=controller=] and the [=identifier=] [=controller=]. Updating the
document is how you control the [=identifier=]. These terms can be used
interchangeably. Controlling the canonical [=controlled identifier document=] for
an [=identifier=] is the same as controlling the [=identifier=].
            </p>
            <dl>
              <dt>controller</dt>
              <dd>
The `controller` property is OPTIONAL. If it is possible to represent
the legitimate controllers of the document as URLs, the document SHOULD
list URLs identifying those controllers.

  <p class="note" title="Presumed Control">
It is possible to list a verification method which is
functionally under the control of someone other than the [=controller=]
of the [=controlled identifier document=]. For example, a document [=controller=] could
set a public key under another party's control as an authentication
verification method. This would enable the other party to authenticate
on behalf of this [=identifier=] (because their public key is listed in
an authentication verification method) <em>without</em> enabling that party
to update the [=controlled identifier document=]. However, since the document
[=controller=] explicitly listed that key for authentication, the
proof in question is taken as created by the document [=controller=], as
it was created by their explicit assignee. This is especially useful
when the "other party" is a device under the control of the document
controller, but with a distinct cryptographic authority, i.e., it
has its own keystore and can generate [=proofs=]. That pattern enables
different devices, each using their own cryptographic material, to
generate verifiable [=proofs=] that are taken as [=proofs=] created by
controller of the identifier.
  </p>
If present, its value MUST be a
<a data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a> or a
<a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-set">set</a> of
<a data-cite="INFRA#string">strings</a>,
each of which conforms to the rules in the [[[URL]]].
            </p>
            <p>
Each entry in the `controller` property MUST identify
an entity capable of updating the canonical version
of the [=controlled identifier document=].
Subsequent requests for this [=controlled identifier document=] through its
canonical location will always receive the latest version.
            </p>
            <p>
If the `controller` property is not present, then control of the document
is determined entirely by its storage location.
              </dd>
            </dl>

            <pre class="example nohighlight"
              title="Controlled identifier document with a controller property">
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/cid/v1",
  "id": "https://controller1.example/123",
  "controller": "https://controllerB.example/abc",
}
            </pre>

            <p>
While the [=identifier=] used for a [=controller=] is unambiguous, this does not
imply that a single entity is always the [=controller=], nor that a [=controller=]
only has a single identifier. A [=controller=] might be a single entity, or a
collection of entities, such as a partnership. A [=controller=] might also use
multiple identifiers to refer to itself, for purposes such as privacy or
delineating operational boundaries within an organization. Similarly, a
[=controller=] might control many [=verification methods=]. For these reasons,
no assumptions are to be made about a [=controller=] being a single entity nor
controlling only a single [=verification method=].
            </p>

            <p class="note" title="Authentication versus Authorization">
Note that the definition of [=authentication=] is different from the definition
of [=authorization=]. Generally speaking, [=authentication=] answers the
question of "Do we know who this is?" while [=authorization=] answers the question of "Are
they allowed to perform this action?". The `authentication` property in this
specification is used to, unsurprisingly, perform [=authentication=] while the
other [=verification relationships=] such as `capabilityDelegation` and
`capabilityInvocation` are used to perform [=authorization=]. Since successfully
performing [=authorization=] might have more serious effects on a system,
[=controllers=] are urged to use different [=verification methods=] when
performing [=authentication=] versus [=authorization=] and provide stronger
access protection for [=verification methods=] used for [=authorization=] versus
[=authentication=]. See [[[#security-considerations]]] for information related
to threat models and attack vectors.

            <h3>Also Known As</h3>

            <p>
A [=subject=] can have multiple identifiers that are used for different purposes
or at different times. The assertion that two or more identifiers (or other types
of URI) refer to the same [=subject=] can be made using the
`alsoKnownAs` property.
            </p>

            <dl>
              <dt>alsoKnownAs</dt>
              <dd>
The `alsoKnownAs` property is OPTIONAL. If present, its value MUST
be a <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-set">set</a> where each item in the
set is a URI conforming to [[RFC3986]].
              </dd>
              <dd>
This relationship is a statement that the subject of this identifier is
also identified by one or more other identifiers.
              </dd>
            </dl>

            <div class="note" title="Equivalence and alsoKnownAs">
              <p>
Applications might choose to consider two identifiers related by `alsoKnownAs`
to be equivalent <em>if</em> the `alsoKnownAs` relationship expressed in the
controlled identifier document of one [=subject=] is also expressed in the reverse direction
(i.e., reciprocated) in the controlled identifier document of the other [=subject=]. It is
best practice <em>not</em> to consider them
equivalent in the absence of this reciprocating relationship. In other words,
the presence of an `alsoKnownAs` assertion does not prove that this assertion
is true. Therefore, it is strongly advised that a requesting party obtain
independent verification of an `alsoKnownAs` assertion.
              </p>
              <p>
Given that the [=subject=] might use different identifiers for different
purposes, such as enhanced privacy protection, an expectation of strong
equivalence between the two identifiers, or taking action to
merge the information from the two corresponding [=controlled identifier documents=], is
not necessarily appropriate, <em>even with</em> a reciprocal relationship.

            <h2>Services</h2>

            <p>
[=Services=] are used in [=controlled identifier documents=] to express ways of
communicating with the [=controller=], or associated entities, in relation to
the controlled [=identifier=]. A [=service=] can be
any type of service the [=controller=] wants to advertise for further discovery,
authentication, authorization, or interaction.
            </p>

            <p>
Due to privacy concerns, revealing public information through [=services=], such
as social media accounts, personal websites, and email addresses, is
discouraged. Further exploration of privacy concerns can be found in sections
[[[#keep-personal-data-private]]] and [[[#service-privacy]]]. The information
associated with [=services=] is often service specific. For example, the
information associated with an encrypted messaging service can express how to
initiate the encrypted link before messaging begins.
            </p>

          <h2>Verification Methods</h2>
          <p>
A [=controlled identifier document=] can express [=verification methods=], such as
cryptographic [=public keys=], which can be used to verify [=proofs=],
such as those used to [=authenticate=] or authorize interactions with the
[=controller=] or associated parties. For example, a cryptographic [=public
key=] can be used as a <a>verification method</a> with respect to a digital
signature; in such use, it verifies that the signer could use the associated
cryptographic private key. <a>Verification methods</a> might take many
parameters. An example of this is a set of five cryptographic keys from which
any three are required to contribute to a cryptographic threshold signature.
          </p>

          <p>
"Verification" and "proof" are intended to apply broadly. For example, a
cryptographic public key might be used during Diffie-Hellman key exchange to
negotiate a shared symmetric key for encryption. This guarantees the integrity
of the key agreement process. It is thus another type of verification method,
even though descriptions of the process might not use the words "verification"
or "proof."
          </p>

          <p>
A [=verification method=] is defined in a [=controlled identifier document=] using the
[=map=] below and is referred to as the
<dfn>verification method definition</dfn>:
          </p>

          <dl>
            <dt><dfn class="lint-ignore">verificationMethod</dfn></dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
The `verificationMethod` property is OPTIONAL. If present, the value
MUST be a <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-set">set</a> of <a>verification
methods</a>, where each [=verification method=] is expressed using a <a
data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a>. The [=verification method=] <a
data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a> MUST include the `id`,
`type`, `controller`, and specific verification material
properties that are determined by the value of `type` and are defined
in [[[#verification-material]]]. A [=verification method=] MAY
include additional properties.

The value of the `id` property for a [=verification method=] MUST be a <a
data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a> that conforms to the [[URL]] syntax. This
value is called the <dfn>verification method identifier</dfn> and can also be
used in a [=proof=] to refer to a specific instance of a [=verification

          <p class="note"
            title="The `controller` property is used by multiple objects">
The `controller` property is used by [=controlled identifier documents=], as described in
Section [[[#controller-documents]]], and by [=verification methods=], as
described in Section [[[#verification-methods]]]. When it is used in either
place, its purpose is essentially the same; that is, it expresses one or more
entities that are authorized to perform certain actions associated with the
resource with which it is associated.
            </p>
            <p>
In the case of the [=controller=] of a [=controlled identifier document=], the
[=controller=] can update the content of the document. In the case of the
[=controller=] of a [=verification method=], the [=controller=] can generate
proofs that satisfy the method.
            </p>
            <p>
To ensure explicit security guarantees, the
[=controller=] of a [=verification method=] cannot be inferred from the
[=controlled identifier document=]. It is necessary to explicitly express the identifier of
the controller of the key because the value of `controller` for a [=verification
method=] is <em>not</em> necessarily the value of the `controller` for a
[=controlled identifier document=].
          </p>

          <section>
            <h3>Verification Material</h3>

            <p>
Verification material is any information that is used by a process that applies
a [=verification method=]. The `type` of a [=verification method=] is
expected to be used to determine its compatibility with such processes. Examples
of verification methods include `JsonWebKey` and `Multikey`.
A [=cryptographic suite=] specification is responsible for specifying the
[=verification method=] `type` and its associated verification material
format. For examples using verification material, see
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-jose-cose/">Securing Verifiable Credentials using JOSE and COSE</a>,
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-di-ecdsa/">the Data Integrity ECDSA
Cryptosuites</a> and <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/lds-ed25519-2020/">
the Data Integrity EdDSA Cryptosuites</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
To increase the likelihood of interoperable implementations, this specification
limits the number of formats for expressing verification material in a
[=controlled identifier document=]. The fewer formats that implementers have to
choose from, the more likely that interoperability will be achieved. This
approach attempts to strike a delicate balance between easing implementation
and providing support for formats that have historically had broad deployment.
            </p>

            <p>
A [=verification method=] MUST NOT contain multiple verification material
properties for the same material. For example, expressing key material in a
[=verification method=] using both `publicKeyJwk` and
`publicKeyMultibase` at the same time is prohibited.
            </p>

            <p>
Implementations MAY convert keys between formats as desired for operational purposes or
to interface with cryptographic libraries. As an internal implementation detail, such
conversion MUST NOT affect the external representation of key material.
            </p>

            <p>
An example of a [=controlled identifier document=] containing <a>verification
methods</a> using both properties above is shown below.

            <h3>JsonWebKey</h3>
            <p>
The JSON Web Key (JWK) data model is a specific type of [=verification method=]
that uses the JWK specification [[RFC7517]] to encode key types into a
set of parameters.
            </p>

            <p>
When specifing a `JsonWebKey`, the object takes the following form:
            </p>

            <dl>
              <dt>type</dt>
              <dd>
The value of the `type` property MUST be a [=string=] that is set to
`JsonWebKey`.
              </dd>
              <dt><dfn class="lint-ignore">publicKeyJwk</dfn></dt>
              <dd>
                <p>
The `publicKeyJwk` property is OPTIONAL. If present, its value MUST
be a <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a> representing a JSON Web Key that
conforms to [[RFC7517]]. The <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a> MUST NOT
include any members of the private information class, such as `d`, as described
in the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517#section-8.1.1">JWK
Registration Template</a>. It is RECOMMENDED that verification methods that use
JWKs [[RFC7517]] to represent their [=public keys=] use the value of `kid` as
their fragment identifier. It is RECOMMENDED that JWK `kid` values are set to
the JWK Thumbprint [[RFC7638]] using the SHA-256 (SHA2-256) hash function of the [=public key=].
See the first key in
[[[#example-various-verification-method-types]]] for an example of a
public key with a compound key identifier.
                </p>
                <p>
As specified in <a data-cite="RFC7517#section-4.4">Section 4.4 of the JWK specification</a>,
the OPTIONAL `alg` property identifies the algorithm intended for use with the public key,
and SHOULD be included to prevent security issues that can arise when using the same
key with multiple algorithms. As specified in <a data-cite="RFC7518#section-6.2.1.1">
Section 6.2.1.1 of the JWA specification</a>, describing a key using an elliptic curve,
the REQUIRED `crv` property is used to identify the particular curve type of the public key.
As specified in <a data-cite="RFC7515#section-4.1.4">Section 4.1.4 of the JWS specification</a>,
the OPTIONAL `kid` property is a hint used to help discover the key; if present, the `kid` value SHOULD
match, or be included in, the `id` property of the encapsulating `JsonWebKey` object,
as part of the path, query, or fragment of the URL.
                </p>

              </dd>
              <dt><dfn class="lint-ignore">secretKeyJwk</dfn></dt>
              <dd>
The `secretKeyJwk` property is OPTIONAL. If present, its value MUST be a <a
data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a> representing a JSON Web Key that conforms
to [[RFC7517]].
It MUST NOT be used if the data structure containing it is public or may be revealed to parties other than the legitimate holders of the secret key.
              </dd>
            </dl>

            <p>
An example of an object that conforms to `JsonWebKey` is provided below:
            </p>

            <pre class="example nohighlight" title="JSON Web Key encoding of a secp384r1 (P-384) public key">
{
  "id": "https://controller.example/123456789abcdefghi#key-1",
  "type": "JsonWebKey",
  "controller": "https://controller.example/123456789abcdefghi",
  "publicKeyJwk": {
      "kid": "key-1",
      "kty": "EC",
      "crv": "P-384",
      "alg": "ES384",
      "x": "1F14JSzKbwxO-Heqew5HzEt-0NZXAjCu8w-RiuV8_9tMiXrSZdjsWqi4y86OFb5d",
      "y": "dnd8yoq-NOJcBuEYgdVVMmSxonXg-DU90d7C4uPWb_Lkd4WIQQEH0DyeC2KUDMIU"
    }
}
            </pre>

            <p>
In the example above, the `publicKeyJwk` value contains the JSON Web Key.
The `kty` property encodes the key type of "EC", which means
"Elliptic Curve". The `alg` property identifies the algorithm intended
for use with the public key, which in this case is `ES384`. The `crv` property identifies
the particular curve type of the public key, `P-384`. The `x` and `y` properties specify
the point on the `P-384` curve that is associated with the public key.
            </p>

            <p>
The `publicKeyJwk` property MUST NOT contain any property marked as
"Private" or "Secret" in any registry contained in the JOSE Registries [[JOSE-REGISTRIES]], including "d".
            </p>

            <p>
The JSON Web Key data model is also capable of encoding <em>secret keys</em>, sometimes
referred to as <em>private keys</em>.
            </p>

            <pre class="example nohighlight"
              title="JSON Web Key encoding of a secp384r1 (P-384) secret key">
{
  "id": "https://controller.example/123456789abcdefghi#key-1",
  "type": "JsonWebKey",
  "controller": "https://controller.example/123456789abcdefghi",
  "secretKeyJwk": {
      "kty": "EC",
      "crv": "P-384",
      "alg": "ES384",
      "d": "fGwges0SX1mj4eZamUCL4qtZijy9uT15fI4gKTuRvre4Kkoju2SHM4rlFOeKVraH",
      "x": "1F14JSzKbwxO-Heqew5HzEt-0NZXAjCu8w-RiuV8_9tMiXrSZdjsWqi4y86OFb5d",
      "y": "dnd8yoq-NOJcBuEYgdVVMmSxonXg-DU90d7C4uPWb_Lkd4WIQQEH0DyeC2KUDMIU"
    }
}
            </pre>

            <p>
The private key example above is almost identical to the previous example of the
public key, except that the information is stored in the `secretKeyJwk` property
(rather than the `publicKeyJwk`), and the private key value is encoded in the `d`
property thereof (alongside the `x` and `y` properties, which still specify
the point on the `P-384` curve that is associated with the public key).

            <h3>Referring to Verification Methods</h3>
            <p>
[=Verification methods=] can be embedded in or referenced from properties
associated with various [=verification relationships=] as described in
[[[#verification-relationships]]]. Referencing [=verification methods=]
allows them to be used by more than one [=verification relationship=].
            </p>

            <p>
If the value of a [=verification method=] property is a <a
data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a>, the [=verification method=] has been
embedded and its properties can be accessed directly. However, if the value is a
URL <a data-cite="INFRA#string">string</a>, the [=verification method=] has
been included by reference and its properties will need to be retrieved from
elsewhere in the [=controlled identifier document=] or from another [=controlled identifier document=]. This
is done by dereferencing the URL and searching the resulting resource for a
[=verification method=] <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-map">map</a> with an
`id` property whose value matches the URL.

          <h2>Verification Relationships</h2>

          <p>
A [=verification relationship=] is an expression that one or more
[=verification methods=] are authorized to verify [=proofs=] made on behalf of
the subject.
          </p>

          <p>
Different [=verification relationships=] enable the associated [=verification
methods=] to be used for different purposes. It is up to a [=verifier=]
to ascertain the validity of a verification attempt by checking that the
[=verification method=] used is referred to by the appropriate [=verification
relationship=] property in the [=controlled identifier document=].
          </p>

          <p>
The [=verification relationship=] between the [=subject=] and the [=verification
method=] is explicit in the [=controlled identifier document=]. [=Verification methods=]
that are not associated with a particular [=verification relationship=] cannot
be used for that [=verification relationship=]. For example, a [=verification
method=] associated with the [=authentication=] property cannot be used to
engage in key agreement protocols &mdash; the value of the
<a href="#defn-keyAgreement">keyAgreement</a> property needs to be used for
that.
          </p>

          <p>
If a referenced [=verification method definition=] is not in the latest
[=controlled identifier document=] used to dereference it, then that [=verification
method=] is considered invalid or revoked.
          </p>

          <p>
The following sections define several useful [=verification relationships=]. A
[=controlled identifier document=] MAY include any of these, or other properties, to
express a specific [=verification relationship=]. To maximize interoperability,
any such properties used SHOULD be registered in the list of
[[[DID-EXTENSIONS-PROPERTIES]]].
          </p>

          <section>
            <h2>Authentication</h2>

            <p>
The `authentication` [=verification relationship=] is used to specify how the
[=subject=] is expected to be [=authenticated=], for purposes such as logging
into a website or engaging in any sort of challenge-response protocol. The
processing performed following authentication is application-specific.
            </p>

            <dl>
              <dt id="defn-authentication">authentication</dt>
              <dd>
The `authentication` property is OPTIONAL. If present, its
value MUST be a <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-set">set</a> of one or more
[=verification methods=]. Each [=verification method=] MAY be embedded or
referenced.
              </dd>

            <p>
This is useful to any entity verifying authentication that needs to check
whether an entity that is attempting to [=authenticate=] is presenting a valid
proof of authentication. When such an authentication-verifying entity receives
some data (in some protocol-specific format) that contains a [=proof=] that was made
for the purpose of "authentication", and that says that an entity is identified
by the `id`, then that <em>verifier</em> checks to ensure that the [=proof=] can be
verified using a [=verification method=] (for example, [=public key=]) listed
under `authentication` in the [=controlled identifier document=].
            </p>
            <p>
Note that the [=verification method=] indicated by the
`authentication` property of a [=controlled identifier document=] can
only be used to [=authenticate=] on behalf
of the [=controlled identifier document=]'s [=base identifier=].

          <section>
            <h2>Assertion</h2>

            <p>
The `assertionMethod` [=verification relationship=] is used to
specify [=verification methods=] that a [=controller=] authorizes for use
when expressing assertions or claims, such as in verifiable credentials.
            </p>

            <dl>
              <dt id="defn-assertionMethod">assertionMethod</dt>

The `assertionMethod` property is OPTIONAL. If present, its associated

be embedded or referenced.
              </dd>
            </dl>

            <p>
This property is useful, for example, during the processing of a
verifiable credential by a verifier.
<!-- VC-DATA-INTEGRITY-SPECIFIC:
During verification, a verifier checks to see if a
[=verifiable credential=] contains a [=proof=] created by the [=controller=]

            <h2>Key Agreement</h2>

            <p>
The `keyAgreement` [=verification relationship=] is used to
specify how an entity can perform encryption in order to transmit
confidential information intended for the [=controller=], such as for
the purposes of establishing a secure communication channel with the recipient.

[=verification methods=]. Each [=verification method=] MAY be embedded or
referenced.
              </dd>
            </dl>

            <p>
An example of when this property is useful is when encrypting a message intended
for the [=controller=]. In this case, the counterparty uses the
cryptographic [=public key=] information in the [=verification method=] to
wrap a decryption key for the recipient.

            <h2>Capability Invocation</h2>

            <p>
The `capabilityInvocation` [=verification relationship=] is used
to specify a [=verification method=] that might be used by the
[=controller=] to invoke a cryptographic capability, such as the
authorization to update the [=controlled identifier document=].
            </p>

            <dl>
              <dt id="defn-capabilityInvocation">capabilityInvocation</dt>
              <dd>
The `capabilityInvocation` property is OPTIONAL. If present, the
associated value MUST be a <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-set">set</a> of
one or more [=verification methods=]. Each [=verification method=] MAY be
embedded or referenced.
              </dd>
            </dl>

            <p>
An example of when this property is useful is when a [=controller=] needs to
access a protected HTTP API that requires authorization in order to use it. In
order to authorize when using the HTTP API, the [=controller=]
uses a capability that is associated with a particular URL that is
exposed via the HTTP API. The invocation of the capability could be
expressed in a number of ways, for example, as a digitally signed
message that is placed into the HTTP Headers.
            </p>
            <p>
The server providing the HTTP API is the <em>verifier</em> of the capability and
it would need to verify that the [=verification method=] referred to by the
invoked capability exists in the `capabilityInvocation`
property of the [=controlled identifier document=]. The verifier would also check to make sure
that the action being performed is valid and the capability is appropriate for
the resource being accessed. If the verification is successful, the server has
cryptographically determined that the invoker is authorized to access the
protected resource.

            <h2>Capability Delegation</h2>

            <p>
The `capabilityDelegation` [=verification relationship=] is used to specify a
mechanism that might be used to delegate a cryptographic
capability to another party. The mechanism, such as an
<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/zcap-spec/">Authorization Capability</a>
or a <a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg/spec/blob/main/README.md">UCAN</a>, and
the processing performed following delegation, such as accessing a specific HTTP
API, is application-specific.
            </p>

            <dl>
              <dt id="defn-capabilityDelegation">capabilityDelegation</dt>
              <dd>
The `capabilityDelegation` property is OPTIONAL. If present, the
associated value MUST be a <a data-cite="INFRA#ordered-set">set</a> of
one or more [=verification methods=]. Each [=verification method=] MAY be
embedded or referenced.
              </dd>
            </dl>

            <p>
An example of when this property is useful is when a [=controller=] chooses
to delegate their capability to access a protected HTTP API to a party other
than themselves. In order to delegate the capability, the [=controller=]
would use a [=verification method=] associated with the
`capabilityDelegation` [=verification relationship=] to
cryptographically sign the capability over to another [=controller=]. The
delegate would then use the capability in a manner that is similar to the
example described in [[[#capability-invocation]]].

A Multibase value encodes a binary value as a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-to-text_encoding">base-encoded
string</a>. The value starts with a single character header, which identifies
the base and encoding alphabet used to encode a binary value, followed by the

length in bytes (encoded as a varint), and the cryptographic digest value, in
that order.

To decode a Multihash value, an implementation MUST 1) remove the prepended

the raw cryptographic digest value which MUST match the expected output length
associated with the Multihash header as well as the output length provided in
the Multihash value itself.

        <h3>Retrieve Verification Method</h3>

        <p>
The following algorithm specifies how to safely retrieve a verification method,
such as a cryptographic [=public key=], by using a [=verification method
identifier=]. Required inputs are a <strong>[=verification method
identifier=]</strong> (<var>vmIdentifier</var>), a
<strong>[=verification relationship=]</strong>
(<var>verificationRelationship</var>), and a set of <strong>dereferencing
options</strong> (<var>options</var>). A
<strong>[=verification method=]</strong> is produced as output.
        </p>

        <ol class="algorithm">
          <li>
If <var>vmIdentifier</var> is not a valid URL, an error MUST be raised and
SHOULD convey an error type of
<a href="#INVALID_VERIFICATION_METHOD_URL">INVALID_VERIFICATION_METHOD_URL</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
Let <var>controllerDocumentUrl</var> be the result of parsing
<var>vmIdentifier</var> according to the rules of the URL scheme and extracting
the primary resource identifier (without the fragment identifier).

Return <var>verificationMethod</var> as the

        </ol>

        <p>
The following example provides a minimum conformant
[=controlled identifier document=] containing a minimum conformant
[=verification method=] as required by the algorithm in this section:
        </p>

        <pre class="example" title="Minimum conformant controlled identifier document">
{
  "id": "https://controller.example/123",
  "verificationMethod": [{
    "id": "https://controller.example/123#key-456",
    "type": "ExampleVerificationMethodType",
    "controller": "https://controller.example/123",
    <span class="comment">// public cryptographic material goes here</span>
  }],
  "authentication": ["#key-456"]
}
        </pre>

        <p class="note" title="Controlled identifier documents can contain references to external verification methods">
[=Verification method identifiers=] are expressed as strings that are URLs, or
via the `id` property, whose value is a URL. It is possible for a [=controlled identifier
document=] to express a [=verification method=], through a [=verification
relationship=], that exists in a place that is external to the [=controlled identifier
document=]. As described in Section [[[#integrity-protection-of-controllers]]],
specifying a [=verification method=] that is external to a [=controlled identifier
document=] is a valid use of this specification. It is vital that this
[=verification method=] is retrieved from the external [=controlled identifier document=].
        </p>

        <p>
When retrieving any [=verification method=] the algorithm above is used to
ensure that the [=verification method=] is retrieved from the correct
[=controlled identifier document=]. The algorithm also ensures that this [=controlled identifier
document=] refers to the [=verification method=] (via a [=verification
relationship=]) and that the [=verification method=] refers to the [=controlled identifier
document=] (via the [=verification method=]'s `controller` property). Failure to
use this algorithm, or an equivalent one that performs these checks, can lead to
security compromises where an attacker poisons a cache by claiming control of a
victim's [=verification method=].
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Referencing an external verification method for `capabilityInvocation`">
{
  "id": "https://controller.example/123",
  "capabilityInvocation": [<span class="highlight">"https://external.example/xyz#key-789"</span>]
}
        </pre>

        <p>
In the example above, the algorithm described in this section will use the
`https://external.example/xyz#key-789` URL value as the [=verification method
identifier=]. The algorithm will then confirm that the [=verification method=]
exists in the external [=controlled identifier document=] and that the appropriate
relationships exist as described earlier in this section.

        <h3>Processing Errors</h3>

        <p>
The algorithms described in this specification throw specific types of errors.
Implementers might find it useful to convey these errors to other libraries or
software systems. This section provides specific URLs, descriptions, and error
codes for the errors, such that an ecosystem implementing technologies described
by this specification might interoperate more effectively when errors occur.
        </p>

        <p>
When exposing these errors through an HTTP interface, implementers SHOULD use
[[RFC9457]] to encode the error data structure. If [[RFC9457]] is used:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
The `type` value of the error object MUST be a URL that starts with the value
`https://w3id.org/security#` and ends with the value in the section listed
below.
          </li>
          <li>
The `code` value MUST be the integer code described in the table below
(in parentheses, beside the type name).
          </li>
          <li>
The `title` value SHOULD provide a short but specific human-readable string for
the error.
          </li>
          <li>
The `detail` value SHOULD provide a longer human-readable string for the error.
          </li>

        </p>

        <p class="note">
          Applications or specifications may define mappings to the
          vocabulary URLs using their own JSON-LD contexts. For example, these mappings are part
          of the `https://w3id.org/security/data-integrity/v2` context,
          defined by the [[[?VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]]] specification, or the `https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1` context,

        </p>

        <section>
          <h4>Context Injection</h4>
          <p>
The `@context` property is used to ensure that implementations are using the
same semantics when terms in this specification are processed. For example, this
can be important when properties like `authentication` are processed and its
value, such as `Multikey` or `JsonWebKey`, are used.
          </p>

          <p>
When an application is processing a [=controlled identifier document=], if an `@context`
property is not provided in the document or the terms used in the document are
not mapped by existing values in the `@context` property, implementations MUST
inject or append an `@context` property with a value of
`https://www.w3.org/ns/cid/v1` or one or more contexts with at least the
same declarations, such as the Decentralized Identifier v1.1 context
(`https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1`).
          </p>

          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="A controlled identifier document without an @context property">
{
  "id": "https://controller.example/101",
  "verificationMethod": [{
    "id": "https://controller.example/101#key-203947",
    "type": "JsonWebKey",

    }
  }],
  "authentication": ["#key-203947"]
}
          </pre>

          <p>
Implementations that do not intend to use JSON-LD MAY choose to not include an
`@context` declaration at the top-level of the document. Whether or not the
`@context` value or JSON-LD processors are used, the semantics for all properties
and values expressed in [=conforming documents=] interpreted by [=conforming
processors=] are the same. Any differences in semantics between documents
processed in either mode are either implementation or specification bugs.

    <h1>Security Considerations</h1>

    <p>
This section contains a variety of security considerations that people using
this specification are advised to consider before deploying this
technology in a production setting. This technologies described in this
document are designed to operate under the threat model used by many IETF
standards and documented in [[?RFC3552]]. This section elaborates upon a number
of the considerations in [[?RFC3552]], as well as other considerations that are
unique to this specification.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Proving Control and Binding</h2>

      <p>
Binding an entity in the digital world or the physical world to an identifier, to
a [=controlled identifier document=], or to cryptographic material requires the use of
security protocols contemplated by this specification. The following sections
describe some possible scenarios and how an entity therein might prove control
over an identifier or a [=controlled identifier document=] for the purposes of authentication or
authorization.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Proving Control of an Identifier and/or Controller Document</h3>

        <p>
Proving control over an identifier and/or a [=controlled identifier document=] is useful
when accessing remote systems. Cryptographic digital signatures enable certain
security protocols related to [=controlled identifier documents=]
to be cryptographically verifiable. For these purposes, this specification
defines useful [=verification relationships=] in <a
href="#authentication"></a> and [[[#capability-invocation]]]. The
secret cryptographic material associated with the [=verification methods=]
can be used to generate a cryptographic digital signature as a part of an
authentication or authorization security protocol.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Binding to Physical Identity</h3>

        <p>
An identifier or [=controlled identifier document=] do not inherently carry any
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data">personal data</a> and
it is strongly advised that non-public entities do not publish personal data in
[=controlled identifier documents=].
        </p>

        <p>
It can be useful to express a binding of an identifier to a person's or
organization's physical identity in a way that is provably asserted by a
trusted authority, such as a government. This specification provides
the [[[#assertion]]] [=verification relationship=] for these
purposes. This feature can enable interactions that are private and can be
considered legally enforceable under one or more jurisdictions; establishing
such bindings has to be carefully balanced against privacy considerations (see
[[[#privacy-considerations]]]).
        </p>

        <p>
The process of binding an identifier to something in the physical world, such as
a person or an organization &mdash; for example, by using <a>verifiable
credentials</a> with the same subject as that identifier &mdash; is contemplated
by this specification and further defined in [[[?VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0]]].
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Identifier Ambiguity</h2>
        <p>
Even in cases where the [=subject=] referred to by an [=identifier=] proves
control, the interpretation of the [=subject=] remains contextual and
potentially ambiguous.
        </p>

        <p>
For example, a school might issue a [=verifiable credential=] about the teacher
of <strong>Intro to Computer Science</strong>, using
`https://controller.example/abc` as a [=subject=] [=identifier=], saying
"`https://controller.example/abc` is the teacher of
<strong>Intro to Computer Science</strong>" and
"`https://controller.example/abc` controls access to the school's computer lab.
See them to request access".
        </p>

        <p>
In this usage, it is ambiguous whether `https://controller.example/abc` refers
to a specific teacher or to whomever is the current teacher. Only with further
statements might we be able to discern the difference. But it's still tricky.
For example the subject in the following statement remains ambiguous:
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight"
             title="Statement about the name of https://controller.example/abc as RDF Triples">
&lt;https://controller.example/abc&gt;
  &lt;https://schema.org/name&gt;
    "Bob Smith" .
        </pre>

        <p>
If `https://controller.example/abc` refers to a specific human being, then the
statement is taken as an attestation about the particular human identified by
that name. However, if `https://controller.example/abc` is used to refer to the
_current_ teacher, it is also valid <em>if the current teacher does have that
name</em>. In this case, the ambiguity is immaterial.
        </p>

        <p>
However, in a statement like the following, the difference becomes vital.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight"
             title="Legal statements the convicted status of https://controller.example/abc as RDF Triples">
&lt;https://controller.example/abc&gt;
  &lt;http://law.example/convicted&gt;
    &lt;http://calaw.example/PenalCode647b&gt; .
        </pre>

        <p>
The statement in English could be "The person referred to by
`https://controller.example/abc` has been convicted of California Penal Code
647b." But which person(s) did we mean? Did we mean to say one, some, or all of
the teachers of computer science at the school have been convicted of violating
`PenalCode647b`? Or is it meant to say that a particular individual teacher,
perhaps the one named "Bob Smith", has been convicted of said crime?
        </p>

        <p>
The challenge is particularly difficult in situations where the [=subject=] is
fundamentally uninvolved in the issuance of the [=verifiable credential=].
For example, an [=identifier=] might be used by a school to refer to a teacher,
and students and or parents might use that [=identifier=] to make statements
about the teacher, with neither the teacher nor the school involved. In these
cases, it is easy to imagine that the subtle nuance of the school's intended
meaning, for example, "any current teacher of the computer science class", gets
lost and the [=identifier=] gets misused by parents and students to refer to a
specific teacher, quite likely in contexts where neither the school nor the
teacher is aware of the conversation.
        </p>
        <p>
In natural language, these ambiguities are often easily ignored or corrected. In
digital media, it is vital that context be evaluated to establish the intended
referent, especially when [=identifiers=] are used in different contexts by
different [=issuers=], for example, on an official school website by the school,
but in an unofficial social networking app by parents and students.
        </p>
        <p>
In short, the context in which [=identifiers=] are created and used has to be
considered when relying on any particular interpretation of the [=subject=] of
any particular [=identifier=].
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Key and Signature Expiration</h2>

      <p>
In a decentralized architecture, there might not be centralized authorities to
enforce cryptographic material or cryptographic digital signature expiration
policies. Therefore, it is with supporting software such as verification
libraries that requesting parties validate that cryptographic materials were not
expired at the time they were used. Requesting parties might employ their own
expiration policies in addition to inputs into their verification processes. For
example, some requesting parties might accept authentications from five minutes
in the past, while others with access to high precision time sources might
require authentications to be time stamped within the last 500 milliseconds.
      </p>
      <p>
There are some requesting parties that have legitimate needs to extend the use
of already-expired cryptographic material, such as verifying legacy
cryptographic digital signatures. In these scenarios, a requesting party might
instruct their verification software to ignore cryptographic key material
expiration or determine if the cryptographic key material was expired at the
time it was used.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Verification Method Rotation</h2>

      <p>
Rotation is a management process that enables the secret cryptographic material
associated with an existing [=verification method=] to be deactivated or
destroyed once a new [=verification method=] has been added to the
[=controlled identifier document=]. Going forward, any new [=proofs=] that a
[=controller=] would have generated using the old secret cryptographic
material can now instead be generated using the new  cryptographic material and
can be verified using the new [=verification method=].
      </p>

      <p>
Rotation is a useful mechanism for protecting against verification method
compromise, since frequent rotation of a verification method by the controller
reduces the value of a single compromised verification method to an attacker.
Performing revocation immediately after rotation is useful for verification
methods that a controller designates for short-lived verifications, such as
those involved in encrypting messages and authentication.
      </p>

      <p>
The following considerations might be of use when contemplating the use of
[=verification method=] rotation:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
[=Verification method=] rotation is a proactive security measure.
        </li>
        <li>
It is generally considered a best practice to perform [=verification method=]
rotation on a regular basis.
        </li>
        <li>
Higher security environments tend to employ more frequent verification method
rotation.
        </li>
        <li>
[=Verification method=] rotation manifests only as changes to the current or
latest version of a [=controlled identifier document=].
        </li>
        <li>
When a [=verification method=] has been active for a long time, or used for
many operations, a controller might wish to perform a rotation.
        </li>
        <li>
Frequent rotation of a [=verification method=] might be frustrating for
parties that are forced to continuously renew or refresh associated credentials.
        </li>
        <li>
Proofs or signatures that rely on [=verification methods=] that are not
present in the latest version of a [=controlled identifier document=] are not impacted by
rotation. In these cases, verification software might require additional
information, such as when a particular [=verification method=] was
expected to be valid as well as access to a verifiable data registry
containing a historical record, to determine the validity of the [=proof=] or
signature. This option might not be available in all systems.
        </li>
        <li>
A [=controller=] performs a rotation when it adds a new <a>verification
method</a> that is meant to replace an existing [=verification method=] after
some time.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Verification Method Revocation</h2>

      <p>
Revocation is a management process that enables the secret cryptographic
material associated with an existing [=verification method=] to be
deactivated such that it ceases to be a valid form of creating new
proofs.
      </p>
      <p>
Revocation is a useful mechanism for reacting to a verification method
compromise. Performing revocation immediately after rotation is useful for
verification methods that a controller designates for short-lived verifications,
such as those involved in encrypting messages and authentication.
      </p>

      <p>
Compromise of the secrets associated with a [=verification method=] allows
the attacker to use them according to the [=verification relationship=]
expressed by [=controller=] in the [=controlled identifier document=], for example, for
authentication. The attacker's use of the secrets might be indistinguishable
from the legitimate [=controller=]'s use starting from
the time the [=verification method=] was registered, to the time it was
revoked.
      </p>


      <p>
The following considerations might be of use when contemplating the use of
[=verification method=] revocation:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
[=Verification method=] revocation is a reactive security measure.
        </li>

        <li>
It is considered a best practice to support key revocation.
        </li>

        <li>
A [=controller=] is expected to immediately revoke any <a>verification
method</a> that is known to be compromised.
        </li>

        <li>
[=Verification method=] revocation can only be embodied in changes to
the latest version of a [=controlled identifier document=]; it cannot retroactively adjust
previous versions.
        </li>

        <li>
If a [=verification method=] is no longer exclusively accessible to the
[=controller=] or parties trusted to act on behalf of the [=controller=],
it is expected to be revoked immediately to reduce the risk of
compromises such as masquerading, theft, and fraud.
        </li>

        <li>
Revocation is expected to be understood as a [=controller=] expressing that
proofs or signatures associated with a revoked [=verification method=]
created after its revocation should be treated as invalid. It could also imply a
concern that existing [=proofs=] or signatures might have been created by an
attacker, but this is not necessarily the case. Verifiers, however, might still
choose to accept or reject any such [=proofs=] or signatures at their own
discretion.
        </li>

        <li>
Even if a [=verification method=] is present in a [=controlled identifier document=],
additional information, such as a public key revocation certificate, or an
external allow or deny list, could be used to determine whether a
[=verification method=] has been revoked.
        </li>

        <li>
The day-to-day operation of any software relying on a compromised
[=verification method=], such as an individual's operating system, antivirus,
or endpoint protection software, could be impacted when the <a>verification
method</a> is publicly revoked.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <section>
        <h3>Revocation Semantics</h3>

        <p>
Although verifiers might choose not to accept [=proofs=] or signatures from a
revoked verification method, knowing whether a verification was made with a
revoked [=verification method=] is trickier than it might seem. Some auditing
systems provide the ability to look back at the state of an identifier at a
point in time, or at a particular version of the [=controlled identifier document=].
When such a feature is combined with a reliable way to determine the time or
identifier version that existed when a cryptographically verifiable statement
was made, then revocation does not undo that statement. This can be the basis
for using digital signatures to make binding commitments; for example, to sign
a mortgage.
        </p>
        <p>
If these conditions are met, revocation is not retroactive; it only nullifies
future use of the method.
        </p>
        <p>
However, in order for such semantics to be safe, the second condition &mdash; an
ability to know what the state of the [=controlled identifier document=] was at the time
the assertion was made &mdash; is expected to apply. Without that guarantee,
someone could discover a revoked key and use it to make cryptographically
verifiable statements with a simulated date in the past.
        </p>
        <p>
Some auditing systems only allow the retrieval of the current state of a
identifier. When this is true, or when the state of an identifier at the time of
a cryptographically verifiable statement cannot be reliably determined, then the
only safe course is to disallow any consideration of state with respect to time,
except the present moment. Identifier ecosystems that take this approach
essentially provide cryptographically verifiable statements as ephemeral tokens
that can be invalidated at any time by the [=controller=].
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Choosing a Multiformat</h2>

      <p>
<dfn class="external lint-ignore">Multiformats</dfn> enable self-describing
data; if data is known to be a Multiformat, its exact type can be determined by
reading a few compact header bytes that are expressed at the beginning of the
data. <a href="#multibase-0">Multibase</a>, <a href="#multihash">Multihash</a>,
and <a href="#Multikey">Multikey</a> are types of Multiformats that are defined
by this specification.
      </p>

      <p>
The Multiformats specifications exist because application developers
appropriately choose different base-encoding functions, cryptographic
hashing functions, and cryptographic key formats, among other things,
based on different use cases and their requirements. No single
base-encoding function, cryptographic hashing function, or cryptographic
key format in the world has ever satisfied all requirement sets.
Multiformats provides an alternative means by which to encode and/or
detect any base-encoding, cryptographic hash, or cryptographic key
format in self-documenting data and documents.
      </p>

      <p>
To increase interoperability, specification authors are urged to minimize
the number of Multiformats &mdash; optimally, choosing only one &mdash; to
be used for any particular application or ecosystem.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Encrypted Data in Controller Documents</h2>
      <p>
Encryption algorithms have been known to fail due to advances in cryptography
and computing power. Implementers are advised to assume that any encrypted data
placed in a [=controlled identifier document=] might eventually be made available in clear text
to the same audience to which the encrypted data is available. This is
particularly pertinent if the [=controlled identifier document=] is public.
      </p>
      <p>
Encrypting all or parts of a [=controlled identifier document=] is <em>not</em> an appropriate
means to protect data in the long term. Similarly, placing encrypted data in
a [=controlled identifier document=] is not an appropriate means to protect personal data.
      </p>
      <p>
Given the caveats above, if encrypted data is included in a [=controlled identifier document=],
implementers are advised to not associate any correlatable information
that could be used to infer a relationship between the encrypted data
and an associated party. Examples of correlatable information include
public keys of a receiving party, identifiers to digital assets known to be
under the control of a receiving party, or human readable descriptions of a
receiving party.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Content Integrity Protection</h2>
      <p>
[=Controlled identifier documents=] that include links to external machine-readable
content such as images, web pages, or schemas are vulnerable to tampering. It is
strongly advised that external links are integrity protected using mechanisms to
secure related resources such as those described in the [[[?VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0]]]
specification. External links are to be avoided if they cannot be integrity
protected and the [=controlled identifier document=]'s integrity is dependent on the
external link.
      </p>
      <p>
One example of an external link where the integrity of the [=controlled identifier
document=] itself could be affected is the JSON-LD Context [[JSON-LD11]],
when present. To protect against compromise,
[=controlled identifier document=] consumers using JSON-LD are advised to cache
local static copies of JSON-LD contexts and/or verify the integrity of external
contexts against a cryptographic hash that is known to be associated with a safe
version of the external JSON-LD Context.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Integrity Protection of Controllers</h2>

      <p>
As described in Section [[[#controllers]]], this specification includes a
mechanism by which to delegate change control of a [=controlled identifier document=] to
an entity that is described in an external [=controlled identifier document=] through the
use of the `controller` property.
      </p>

      <p>
Delegating change control addresses a number of use cases including those
where the care of an entity is the responsibility of some other entity or
entities, as well as those where some entity desires that another entity
provide account recovery services, among other use cases. In such scenarios,
it can be beneficial to allow the guardian to manage the rotation of their
own key material. It can also be beneficial for the delegator to associate
a cryptographic hash of the remote [=controlled identifier document=] to "pin" the
remote document to a known good value.
      </p>

      <p>
While this document does not specify a particular mechanism for
cryptographically protected URLs, the `relatedResource` property in
[[[VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0]]] and the `digestMultibase` property in
[[[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]]] could be employed by a mechanism that can provide
such protection.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Level of Assurance</h2>

      <p>
Additional information about the security context of authentication events is
often required for compliance reasons, especially in regulated areas such as the
financial and public sectors. This information is often referred to as a Level
of Assurance (LOA). Examples include the protection of secret cryptographic
material, the identity [=proof=]ing process, and the form-factor of the
authenticator.
      </p>

      <p>

assurance frameworks are classified and defined by regulations and

29115:2013</a>, including their requirements for the security context, and

authentication where <a target="_blank"
href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">FIDO2</a>/<a target="_blank"
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/">WebAuthn</a> can fulfill the
requirement.
      </p>

      <p>
Some regulated scenarios require the implementation of a specific level of
assurance. Since [=verification relationships=] used to perform
<a href="#assertion">assertion</a> and [=authentication=] might be
used in some of these situations, information about the applied security context
might need to be expressed and provided to a <em>verifier</em>. Whether and how
to encode this information in the [=controlled identifier document=] data model is out
of scope for this specification. Interested readers might note that 1) the
information could be transmitted using Verifiable Credentials
[[?VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0]], and 2) the [=controlled identifier document=] data model can be
extended to incorporate this information.
      </p>

      <h2>Service Endpoints for Authentication and Authorization</h2>

      <p>
If a [=controlled identifier document=] publishes a [=service=] intended for authentication
or authorization of the [=subject=] (see Section [[[#services]]]), it is the
responsibility of the [=service=] provider, [=subject=], and/or requesting party
to comply with the requirements of the authentication and/or authorization
protocols supported by that [=service=] endpoint.
      </p>
    </section>

  </section>

  <section class="informative">
    <h1>Privacy Considerations</h1>

    <p>
Since [=controlled identifier documents=] are designed to be administered directly by
the [=controller=], it is critically important to apply the principles of
Privacy by Design [[PRIVACY-BY-DESIGN]] to all aspects of the
[=controlled identifier document=]. All seven of these principles have been applied
throughout the development of this specification. The design used in this
specification does not assume that there is a registrar, hosting company, nor
other intermediate service provider to recommend or apply additional privacy
safeguards. Privacy in this specification is preventive, not remedial, and is an
embedded default. The following sections cover privacy considerations that
implementers might find useful when building systems that utilize [=controlled identifier
documents=].
    </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Keep Personal Data Private</h2>

      <p>
If a [=controlled identifier document=] is about a specific individual and is
public-facing, it is <em>critical</em> that [=controlled identifier documents=] contain
no personal biometric or biographical data. While it is true that personal data
might include pseudonymous information, such as a public cryptographic key or an IP address,
publishing that sort of information does not create the same immediate privacy
dangers as publishing an individual's full name, profile photo, or social media
account in a [=controlled identifier document=]. A better alternative is to transmit
such personal data through other means such as verifiable credentials
[[?VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0]] or other data formats sent over private and secure
communication channels.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Relationship to the Same-Origin Policy</h3>

      <p>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy">
Same-origin policy</a> is a security and privacy concept that constrains
information to the same Web domain by default. There are mechanisms, such as
[[[?WEBAUTHN]]], that extend this policy to cryptographic keys. When a
cryptographic key is bound to a specific domain, it is sometimes referred to
as a <dfn>pairwise identifier</dfn>.
      </p>
      <p>
The same-origin policy can be overridden for a variety of use cases, such as
for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing">
Cross-origin resource sharing</a> (CORS). This specification allows for the
cross-origin resource sharing of verification methods and service endpoints,
which means that correlatable identifiers might be shared between origins. While
resource sharing can lead to positive security outcomes (reduced cryptographic
key registration burden), it can also lead to negative privacy outcomes
(tracking). Those that use this specification are warned that there are
trade-offs with each approach and to use the mechanism that maximizes security
and privacy according to the needs of the individual or organization. Using a
[=controlled identifier document=] for all use cases is not always advantageous when a
same-origin bound cryptographic key would suffice.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Identifier Correlation Risks</h2>

      <p>
Identifiers can be used for unwanted correlation. [=Controllers=] can
mitigate this privacy risk by using [=pairwise identifiers=] that are unique to
each relationship or interaction domain; in effect, each identifier acts as a pseudonym. A [=pairwise
identifier=] need only be shared with more than one party when correlation
across contexts is explicitly desired. If [=pairwise identifiers=] are the default,
then the only
need to publish an identifier openly, or to share it with multiple parties, is
when the [=controllers=] and/or [=subjects=] explicitly desire public
identification and correlation across interaction domains.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Controller Document Correlation Risks</h2>

      <p>
The anti-correlation protections of [=pairwise identifiers=] are easily defeated
if the data in the corresponding [=controlled identifier documents=] can be correlated. For
example, using identical [=verification methods=] in multiple [=controlled identifier
documents=] can provide as much correlation information as using the same
identifier. Therefore, the [=controlled identifier document=] for a [=pairwise identifier=]
also needs to use pairwise unique information, such as ensuring that
[=verification methods=] are unique to the pairwise relationship.
      </p>

      <p>
It is dangerous to add properties to the [=controlled identifier document=] that can be
used to indicate, explicitly or through inference, what <em>type</em> or nature
of thing the [=subject=] is, particularly if the [=subject=] is a person.
      </p>
      <p>
Not only do such properties potentially result in personal data (see
[[[#keep-personal-data-private]]]) or correlatable data (see <a
href="#identifier-correlation-risks"> </a> and
[[[#controller-document-correlation-risks]]]) being present in
the [=controlled identifier document=], but they can be used for grouping particular
identifiers in such a way that they are included in or excluded from certain
operations or functionalities.
      </p>
      <p>
Including <em>type</em> information in a [=controlled identifier document=] can result
in personal privacy harms even for [=subjects=] that are non-person entities,
such as IoT devices. The aggregation of such information around a
[=controller=] could serve as a form of digital fingerprint and this is best
avoided.
      </p>
      <p>
To minimize these risks, all properties in a [=controlled identifier document=] ought to
be for expressing [=verification methods=] and <a>verification
relationships</a> related to using the identifier.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Service Privacy</h2>
      <p>
The ability for a [=controller=] to optionally express at least one [=service=] in the [=controlled identifier document=] increases their control and agency.
Each additional endpoint in the [=controlled identifier document=] adds privacy risk either
due to correlation, such as across endpoint descriptions, or because the
[=services=] are not protected by an authorization mechanism, or both.
      </p>
      <p>
[=Controlled identifier documents=] are often public and, since they are standardized, will
be stored and indexed efficiently. This
risk is increased if [=controlled identifier documents=] are published to immutable
[=verifiable data registries=]. Access to a history of the [=controlled identifier
documents=] referenced by a URL enables a form of traffic analysis made more
efficient through the use of standards.
      </p>
      <p>
The degree of additional privacy risk caused by including multiple [=services=] in
one [=controlled identifier document=] can be difficult to estimate. Privacy harms are
typically unintended consequences. URLs can refer to documents, [=services=],
schemas, and other things that might be associated with individual people,
households, clubs, and employers &mdash; and correlation of their [=services=]
could become a powerful surveillance and inference tool. An example of
this potential harm can be seen when multiple common country-level top level
domains such as `https://example.co.uk` might be used to infer the approximate
location of the [=subject=] with a greater degree of probability.

      <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>
      <p>
The following section describes accessibility considerations that developers
implementing this specification are urged to consider in order to ensure that
their software is usable by people with different cognitive, motor, and visual
needs. As a general rule, this specification is used by system software and does
not directly expose individuals to information subject to accessibility
considerations. However, there are instances where individuals might be
indirectly exposed to information expressed by this specification and thus the
guidance below is provided for those situations.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Presenting Time Values</h2>
        <p>
This specification enables the expression of dates and times related to the
validity period of [=proofs=]. This information might be indirectly
exposed to an individual if a [=proof=] is processed and is detected to be outside
an allowable time range. When exposing these dates and times to an individual,
implementers are urged to take into account
<a data-cite="?VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0#representing-time">cultural normas and locales
when representing dates and times</a> in display software. In addition to these
considerations, presenting time values in a way that eases the cognitive burden
on the individual receiving the information is a suggested best practice.
        </p>
        <p>
For example, when conveying the expiration date for a particular set of
digitally signed information, implementers are urged to present the time of
expiration using language that is easier to understand rather than language that
optimizes for accuracy. Presenting the expiration time as "This ticket expired
three days ago." is preferred over a phrase such as "This ticket expired on July
25th 2023 at 3:43 PM." The former provides a relative time that is easier to
comprehend than the latter time, which requires the individual to do the
calculation in their head and presumes that they are capable of doing such a
calculation.

      <p>
The specification authors would like to thank the contributors to the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2022/REC-did-core-20220719/">
W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0</a> specification upon which this work
is based.
      </p>

      <p>
The Working Group gratefully acknowledges the work that led to the creation of
this specification, and extends sincere appreciation to those individuals that
worked on technologies and specifications that deeply influenced our work. In
particular, this includes the work of Phil Zimmerman, Jon Callas, Lutz
Donnerhacke, Hal Finney, David Shaw, and Rodney Thayer on <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy"> Pretty Good Privacy
(PGP)</a> in the 1990s and 2000s.
      </p>

      <p>
In the mid-2010s, preliminary implementations of what would become Decentralized
Identifiers were <a href="https://github.com/web-payments/minutes/blob/master/2014-05-07/irc.log#L5">
built</a> in collaboration with Jeremie Miller's Telehash project and the W3C
Web Payments Community Group's work led by Dave Longley and Manu Sporny. Around
a year later, the XDI.org Registry Working Group
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EP-KhH60y-nl4xkEzoeSf3DjmjLomfboF4p2umF51FA/">
began exploring</a> decentralized technologies for replacing its existing
identifier registry. Some of the first
<a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot1-sf/blob/master/final-documents/dpki.pdf">written</a>
<a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot2-id2020/blob/master/final-documents/requirements-for-dids.pdf">papers</a>
exploring the concept of Decentralized Identifiers can be traced back to the
first several Rebooting the Web of Trust workshops convened by Christopher
Allen. That work led to a key collaboration between Christopher Allen, Drummond
Reed, Les Chasen, Manu Sporny, and Anil John. Anil saw promise in the technology
and allocated the initial set of government funding to explore the space.
Without the support of Anil John and his guidance through the years, it is
unlikely that Decentralized Identifiers would be where they are today. Further
refinement at the Rebooting the Web of Trust workshops led to the <a
href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot3-sf/blob/master/final-documents/did-implementer-draft-10.pdf">first
implementers documentation</a>, edited by Drummond Reed, Les Chasen, Christopher
Allen, and Ryan Grant. Contributors included Manu Sporny, Dave Longley, Jason
Law, Daniel Hardman, Markus Sabadello, Christian Lundkvist, and Jonathan
Endersby. This initial work was then merged into the W3C Credentials Community
Group, incubated further, and then transitioned to the W3C Decentralized
Identifiers Working Group for global standardization. That work was then used
as the basis for this, more generalized and less decentralized, specification.
